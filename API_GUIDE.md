## üí∞ Cost Breakdown & Optimization

### Per Episode Costs (Proven Results)
```yaml
research_phase:
  perplexity_queries: "$0.50-1.00"
  fact_verification: "$0.25-0.50"
  synthesis: "$0.25-0.50"
  total_research: "$1.00-2.00"

script_phase:
  writing: "$0.50-0.75"
  quality_validation: "$0.50-0.75"
  polishing: "$0.25-0.50"
  total_script: "$1.25-2.00"

audio_phase:
  voice_synthesis: "$2.00-3.00"
  quality_validation: "$0.25-0.50"
  total_audio: "$2.25-3.50"

total_per_episode: "$4.50-7.50"
proven_average: "$5.51"
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Single-Call Audio Synthesis**
- **Benefit**: No audio concatenation needed
- **Requirement**: Scripts under 40,000 characters (95% of episodes)
- **Savings**: 20-30% cost reduction vs chunked synthesis

**Research Caching**
- **Benefit**: Reuse research for related topics
- **Implementation**: 24-hour cache for expert information
- **Savings**: 30-40% for series on related topics

**Batch Processing**
- **Benefit**: Parallel processing efficiency gains
- **Savings**: 25-30% cost reduction for 10+ episodes
- **Optimal**: 5 concurrent episodes maximum

## üõ°Ô∏è Budget Controls & Monitoring

### Automated Cost Controls
```bash
# Set in .env file
MAX_COST_PER_EPISODE=5.00
DAILY_COST_LIMIT=20.00
BUDGET_ALERT_THRESHOLD=8.00
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Check current spending
grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" .claude/logs/cost-tracking.log

# View cost by operation type
./scripts/cost-analysis.sh

# Get cost breakdown for specific episode
./scripts/episode-cost-report.sh [episode-number]
```

### Cost Protection Features
- **Pre-validation**: Budget checking before expensive operations
- **Real-time tracking**: Live cost monitoring during production
- **Alert system**: Warnings at 80% of budget limits
- **Emergency stop**: Automatic halt at budget limits

## üìä API Usage Optimization

### Perplexity Optimization
```yaml
query_optimization:
  model_selection:
    discovery: "sonar-pro ($5/1M tokens)"
    deep_research: "sonar-reasoning ($5/1M tokens)"

  token_management:
    max_per_query: 8192
    typical_usage: 3000-5000
    cost_per_episode: "$1.00-2.00"

  caching_strategy:
    research_results: "24 hour cache"
    expert_profiles: "7 day cache"
    common_topics: "30 day cache"
```

### ElevenLabs Optimization
```yaml
synthesis_optimization:
  voice_settings:
    voice_id: "ZF6FPAbjXT4488VcRRnw"  # Validated Amelia voice
    model: "eleven_turbo_v2_5"
    stability: 0.65
    similarity: 0.8
    style: 0.3

  cost_efficiency:
    single_call_limit: "40,000 characters"
    chunking_fallback: "5,000 character chunks with 100 char overlap"
    cost_per_1000_chars: "$0.30"

  quality_optimization:
    ssml_processing: "Natural pauses and emphasis"
    pronunciation_guide: "IPA for technical terms"
    duration_targeting: "28¬±1 minutes"
```

## üîê API Key Security

### Security Best Practices
```bash
# Environment file security
chmod 600 .env              # Restrict file permissions
echo ".env" >> .gitignore   # Never commit to git

# API key validation
./test-mcp-connections.sh   # Test keys work correctly

# Key rotation (recommended monthly)
# 1. Generate new keys on service platforms
# 2. Update .env file
# 3. Test connections
# 4. Revoke old keys
```

### Emergency Procedures
**If API Keys Compromised:**
1. **Immediately revoke** keys on service platforms
2. **Generate new keys** and update .env
3. **Test connections** with ./test-mcp-connections.sh
4. **Monitor usage** for any unauthorized activity
