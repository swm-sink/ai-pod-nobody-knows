## 📝 Actual Usage

**Technical:** Command-line interface operations using Claude Code's built-in command system for multi-agent orchestration
**Simple:** Like typing simple commands to make the system do complex tasks automatically - you say 'produce episode' and it handles everything

### Producing an Episode (Claude Code Commands)

**In Claude Code interface:**

```
# Produce a complete episode (research + production)
/produce-episode

# Research only (save for later production)
/produce-research

# Batch production of multiple episodes
/produce-series

# Review and validate existing research
/review-research
```

### Available Production Commands (4 Total)
- `/produce-episode` - Complete episode production (research → script → audio)
- `/produce-research` - Research stream only (save research for later)
- `/produce-series` - Batch production of multiple episodes
- `/review-research` - Validate and review existing research packages

---

## 💰 Actual Costs

**Technical:** Token-based pricing model with API rate optimization and batch processing for cost efficiency
**Simple:** Like paying for phone minutes - you only pay for what you use, and we've optimized to use as few 'minutes' as possible

### Proven Results (Solo/Hobby)
- **Per Episode**: $5.51 (achieved) vs $800-3500 traditional
- **Episode Length**: 27 minutes
- **Daily Limit**: $15.00
- **Alert at**: $10.00

### API Costs (ESTIMATED)
- **Perplexity**: Research (~$2-3)
- **ElevenLabs**: Audio synthesis (~$1-2)
- **Claude Code**: Built-in (no extra cost)
