# AI Podcasts - Nobody Knows 🎙️

**A solo hobby project using Claude Code's native capabilities to produce an automated podcast series**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

An automated podcast production system using **Claude Code's native AI capabilities** to create a 125-episode AI-focused series called "Nobody Knows" - teaching AI through radical honesty about technological confusion. (See `projects/nobody-knows/series_plan/episodes_master.json` for complete episode list)

### Built With:
- **Claude Code agents** for orchestration and content creation
- **MCP integrations** for research (Perplexity) and audio (ElevenLabs)
- **Level-based architecture** for progressive development
- **Solo hobby focus** keeping things simple and learnable

---

## 🏗️ Four-Level Architecture

**Technical:** Hierarchical separation with strict dependency management and approval gates  
**Simple:** Like building levels in a video game - you must complete each before unlocking the next

```
Level 1: Development Platform (COMPLETE)
├── Purpose: Build tools that build the production system
├── Location: .claude/level-1-dev/
├── Status: ✅ Agent builders and command builders ready
└── Learning: Meta-programming and tool creation

Level 2: Native Claude Code Production (CURRENT FOCUS) 🎯
├── Purpose: Actual podcast production using Claude's built-in AI
├── Location: .claude/level-2-production/
├── Components:
│   ├── Claude Code AI (script writing & quality evaluation)
│   ├── Perplexity MCP (web research)
│   └── ElevenLabs MCP (audio synthesis)
├── Status: ⏳ Phase 7 - Testing after restart
└── Learning: Production system design and reliability

Level 3: Platform Planning (DOCUMENTATION ONLY)
├── Purpose: Design and document future platform
├── Location: .claude/level-3-platform-dev/
├── Status: 📝 Planning phase only - no code
└── Learning: Architectural planning and migration strategy

Level 4: Coded Python Platform (LOCKED 🔒)
├── Purpose: Future FastAPI implementation
├── Technologies: OpenRouter + Langfuse
├── Status: ⚠️ REQUIRES EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL
├── Gate: User must say "Approved for Level 4 implementation"
└── Learning: Enterprise patterns and observability

## 🚀 Actual Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed
- Python 3.11+ (for ElevenLabs MCP)
- Node.js (for Perplexity MCP)
- API keys for Perplexity and ElevenLabs

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-podcasts-nobody-knows.git
cd ai-podcasts-nobody-knows
```

2. **Set up API keys**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys:
# PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-YOUR-KEY
# ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_YOUR-KEY
```

3. **MCPs are already installed locally** (in .claude/mcp-servers/)
   - Already configured in .mcp.json
   - Git-ignored for security

4. **Restart Claude Code** to load MCPs

5. **Verify MCPs are loaded**
```bash
claude mcp list
# Should show: elevenlabs, perplexity
```

6. **Test the setup**
```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/test_mcps.py
```

## 📝 Actual Usage

### Producing an Episode (Claude Code Commands)

```bash
# Test with dry run first
claude /produce-episode --topic "consciousness" --episode 1 --dry-run

# Actual production
claude /produce-episode --topic "consciousness" --episode 1
```

### Available Commands
- `/produce-episode` - Main production orchestrator
- `/test-episode-dry-run` - Test without API calls
