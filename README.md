# AI Podcasts - Nobody Knows 🎙️

**A simplified automated podcast system using Claude Code's native capabilities**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

A production-ready automated podcast system using Claude Code's native AI to create the "Nobody Knows" series exploring intellectual humility. **Proven cost: $5.51 per episode** vs traditional $800-3500.

### Built With
- **14 specialized Claude Code agents** in two-stream architecture (Research → Production)
- **MCP integrations** for research (Perplexity) and audio (ElevenLabs)
- **Simplified v1.0 architecture** with agent-based organization
- **Educational focus** with mandatory dual explanations (technical + simple)

---

## 🌊 Two-Stream Architecture v1.0

**Technical:** Simplified dual-stream design with clear separation between research and production workflows
**Simple:** Like an assembly line with two stages - first we research a topic thoroughly, then we create the episode

```text
Research Stream (4 agents):
├── 01_research_orchestrator → Coordinates multi-source research
├── 02_deep_research_agent → Perplexity-powered deep research
├── 03_question_generator → Generates targeted research questions
└── 04_research_synthesizer → Research → Production bridge

Production Stream (10 agents):
├── 01_production_orchestrator → Manages complete pipeline
├── 02_episode_planner → Creates episode structure
├── 03_script_writer → Generates podcast script
├── 04_quality_claude → Claude-based quality validation
├── 05_quality_gemini → Gemini-based quality validation
├── 06_feedback_synthesizer → Combines quality feedback
├── 07_script_polisher → Final script optimization
├── 08_final_reviewer → Production approval gate
├── 09_tts_optimizer → Audio preparation
└── 10_audio_synthesizer → ElevenLabs generation
```

## 📝 Actual Usage

**Technical:** Command-line interface operations using Claude Code's built-in command system for multi-agent orchestration
**Simple:** Like typing simple commands to make the system do complex tasks automatically - you say 'produce episode' and it handles everything

### Producing an Episode (Claude Code Commands)

**In Claude Code interface:**

```
# Produce a complete episode (research + production)
/produce-episode

# Research only (save for later production)
/produce-research

# Batch production of multiple episodes
/produce-series

# Review and validate existing research
/review-research
```

### Available Production Commands (4 Total)
- `/produce-episode` - Complete episode production (research → script → audio)
- `/produce-research` - Research stream only (save research for later)
- `/produce-series` - Batch production of multiple episodes
- `/review-research` - Validate and review existing research packages

**Simple:** Like paying for phone minutes - you only pay for what you use, and we've optimized to use as few 'minutes' as possible

### Proven Results (Solo/Hobby)
- **Per Episode**: $5.51 (achieved) vs $800-3500 traditional
- **Episode Length**: 27 minutes
- **Daily Limit**: $15.00
- **Alert at**: $10.00

### API Costs (ESTIMATED)
