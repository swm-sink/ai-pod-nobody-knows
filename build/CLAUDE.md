## üéØ BUILD SYSTEM CONTEXT

**Technical:** Build system memory implementing deployment automation, infrastructure provisioning, continuous integration patterns, and production environment management for scalable AI podcast system deployment.

**Simple:** Like having an automated factory that packages everything up and deploys it perfectly every time.

**Connection:** This teaches DevOps practices, deployment automation, and infrastructure as code essential for production AI applications.
