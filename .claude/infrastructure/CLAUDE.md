## üéØ INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES CONTEXT

**Technical:** Infrastructure services memory implementing state persistence management, memory optimization, system reliability, dashboard integration, and advanced operational capabilities for enterprise-grade AI podcast production infrastructure.

**Simple:** Like having the foundational systems that make everything else possible - the plumbing, electrical, and structural support.

**Connection:** This teaches infrastructure design, system reliability, and operational excellence patterns essential for scalable production AI systems.
