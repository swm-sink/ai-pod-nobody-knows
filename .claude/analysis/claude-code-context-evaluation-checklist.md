# Claude Code Context Management - 100-Item Evaluation Checklist


Aggressive .claudeignore implementation (99.3% context reduction achieved)
Context packages created for LLM optimization
Four-level architecture with clear separation
159 XML + 108 MD files may still overwhelm context management
Multiple CLAUDE.md files without clear hierarchy optimization
No custom commands directory at root level
Subagent orchestration patterns not fully leveraged
MCP server integration potential not maximized
Implement root-level .claude/commands directory - user feedback do not do this
Optimize CLAUDE.md hierarchy and loading strategy
Create subagent orchestration framework
Establish prompt caching optimization
Implement comprehensive TDD with behavioral testing
Optimizing the 200K token window for maximum efficiency and performance
Root CLAUDE.md token count analysis
Main CLAUDE.md is ~357 lines with extensive XML metadata
Compress main CLAUDE.md to &lt;200 lines, move detailed content to @references
Research shows context window placement bias - heavy documents should be minimal at start
/clear command documentation and training
Command documented in CLAUDE.md but no usage tracking
Add /clear usage tracking and automatic suggestions when context &gt;150K tokens
Anthropic recommends frequent /clear usage to prevent context degradation
/compact command integration
Not documented or integrated into workflow
Add /compact to essential commands with automated triggers at 180K tokens
Research shows /compact provides better control than auto-summarization
Token usage monitoring system
No systematic token monitoring in place
Implement /cost command integration with session tracking
Cost optimization requires real-time token awareness per Claude Code best practices
Context bloat prevention patterns
Aggressive .claudeignore but no dynamic monitoring
Add context bloat detection hooks that warn at 100K, 150K, 180K thresholds
Proactive context management prevents performance degradation
Long document placement optimization
Context packages at ~8-12K tokens placed randomly
Ensure 20K+ token documents are placed at prompt start for attention bias
Research shows 30% performance improvement with proper long document placement
Context persistence across sessions
CLAUDE.local.md exists but minimal usage
Expand CLAUDE.local.md with session handover templates
Session continuity essential for long-term project development
Context window utilization metrics
No measurement of actual vs. available context usage
Implement context utilization dashboard showing current/max usage
Context engineering requires visibility into window utilization patterns
Auto-loading vs selective loading balance
Aggressive exclusion in .claudeignore, @references for selective loading
Validate that essential context loads automatically while detailed context requires @references
Balance between convenience and context efficiency is critical
Context compression strategies
XML format provides structure but verbose
Evaluate JSON alternatives for high-frequency access patterns
Format optimization can reduce token usage without losing semantic value
Optimizing the hierarchy and content of CLAUDE.md files for maximum effectiveness
CLAUDE.md hierarchy clarity
3 CLAUDE.md files: root, projects/nobody-knows, CLAUDE.local
Document explicit loading order and precedence rules in root CLAUDE.md
Claude reads CLAUDE.md files in order: home → project root → directories
Root CLAUDE.md conciseness
Root CLAUDE.md contains 5000+ tokens of detailed instructions
Reduce to core instructions (&lt;1000 tokens), move details to @references
Research shows CLAUDE.md files should be lean as they consume context in every session
Project-specific CLAUDE.md optimization
projects/nobody-knows/CLAUDE.md exists but may duplicate root content
Ensure project CLAUDE.md only contains project-specific overrides
Avoid duplication between root and project-level CLAUDE.md files
CLAUDE.local.md utilization
CLAUDE.local.md template exists but underutilized
Expand with personal learning tracking and session notes template
Local memory files enable continuity without polluting shared context
Semantic tagging compliance in CLAUDE.md
Root CLAUDE.md mixes XML tags within markdown
Ensure pure markdown structure as per file format policy
Semantic tagging policy requires XML in .xml files, pure markdown in .md files
Essential commands accessibility
Commands documented in middle of long CLAUDE.md file
Move essential commands to top of file for immediate access
Most-used commands should be immediately visible in context
Cross-reference link validation
Many @references in CLAUDE.md but no validation system
Implement automated link checking for @references in CLAUDE.md files
Broken links in CLAUDE.md lead to context loading failures
Context loading performance impact
No measurement of CLAUDE.md loading time and token cost
Monitor and optimize CLAUDE.md loading performance
CLAUDE.md files load on every session - optimization has cumulative impact
Version control for CLAUDE.md changes
CLAUDE.md changes lack structured review process
Implement change control process per existing change-control section
CLAUDE.md changes affect all sessions - require careful review
Directory-specific CLAUDE.md usage
No directory-specific CLAUDE.md files for specialized contexts
Consider CLAUDE.md in .claude/level-* directories for level-specific instructions
Directory-specific context can improve task focus and reduce context pollution
Evaluating and optimizing file exclusion patterns for context management
Coverage of development artifacts
Excludes node_modules, __pycache__, .git, basic build artifacts
Add coverage for additional dev artifacts: .pytest_cache, .mypy_cache, .tox, coverage reports
Comprehensive artifact exclusion prevents context pollution from generated files
Large file exclusion patterns
Basic *.log exclusion
Add patterns for: *.mp3, *.wav, *.mp4, *.zip, *.tar.gz, *.db, *.sqlite, datasets/
Large binary files can consume significant context tokens without value
Temporary file exclusion
Excludes basic temp patterns
Add: tmp/, temp/, .tmp, swap files, editor backups (*~, *.swp, *.swo)
Temporary files change frequently and add no value to context
IDE and editor exclusions
Basic .DS_Store exclusion
Add: .vscode/, .idea/, *.iml, .project, .classpath, .settings/
IDE files are environment-specific and irrelevant to code logic
Documentation build exclusions
Excludes dist/ and build/
Add: docs/_build/, site/, .docusaurus/, .next/, .nuxt/
Generated documentation consumes context without adding development value
Selective .claude content loading
Aggressive exclusion of all .claude content except NAVIGATION.md
Validate that critical .claude files can be accessed via @references
Balance between context efficiency and accessibility of project documentation
Language-specific exclusions
Python-focused exclusions (__pycache__, .env)
Add patterns for other languages: target/ (Rust), bin/, obj/ (C#), .class (Java)
Multi-language support requires comprehensive build artifact exclusion
Security-sensitive file exclusions
Excludes .env files
Add: *.key, *.pem, *.p12, secrets/, .aws/, .gcp/, api-keys.*, credentials.*
Security files should never be in context for safety and compliance
Pattern specificity and performance
Mix of specific and wildcard patterns
Optimize patterns for performance: specific paths first, wildcards last
Pattern ordering affects file exclusion performance in large codebases
Pattern validation and testing
No automated testing of .claudeignore effectiveness
Create validation script to test exclusion patterns against sample file structures
Pattern validation ensures .claudeignore works as intended across different scenarios
