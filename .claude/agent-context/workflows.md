# Workflows Directory Context

## Purpose
This directory contains workflow orchestration patterns and methodologies for systematic development and production processes.

## Workflow Components

### Meta-Prompting Workflow
- `meta-prompting.md` - 13-step meta-prompting methodology
- Systematic problem-solving and solution development
- Quality assurance through structured thinking
- Learning integration and retrospective analysis

## Workflow Principles

### Systematic Approach
- Structured progression through defined stages
- Quality gates and validation at each step
- Comprehensive documentation and tracking
- Learning integration and continuous improvement

### Integration with Production System
- Workflows support both development and production contexts
- Native Claude Code orchestration patterns
- MCP tool inheritance and external service integration
- Complete observability and audit trails

### Quality Assurance
- Built-in validation and verification steps
- Error recovery and alternative pathway support
- Performance optimization and cost management
- Retrospective learning and improvement cycles

## Meta-Prompting Methodology

The core 13-step workflow provides systematic problem-solving:

1. **Explore** - Initial discovery and problem understanding
2. **Research** - Comprehensive investigation and knowledge gathering
3. **Plan** - Strategic planning and architecture design
4. **Decompose** - Task breakdown and component identification
5. **Implement** - Solution development and execution
6. **Assess** - Quality evaluation and validation
7. **Validate** - Comprehensive testing and verification
8. **Commit** - Change integration and documentation
9. **Retrospect** - Learning extraction and improvement identification
10. **Optimize** - Performance improvement and refinement
11. **Scale** - Scalability planning and implementation
12. **Document** - Knowledge capture and sharing
13. **Integrate** - System integration and operational readiness

## Usage Patterns

### Development Workflows
- New feature development and enhancement
- System architecture improvements
- Quality optimization initiatives
- Technical debt reduction

### Production Workflows
- Episode production orchestration
- Quality assurance validation
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Error recovery and system resilience

### Learning Workflows
- Knowledge extraction from production experience
- System improvement identification
- Best practice development and documentation
- Cross-project learning integration

## Integration Points

Workflows integrate with:
- Command system for execution orchestration
- Agent system for specialized task execution
- Hook system for observability and monitoring
- Documentation system for knowledge capture
- Context management for efficient information access

## Quality Standards

All workflows must:
- Provide clear, actionable guidance
- Include quality gates and validation steps
- Support error recovery and alternative pathways
- Enable learning integration and improvement
- Maintain compatibility with native Claude Code patterns
