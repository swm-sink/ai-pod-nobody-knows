# Research Validation Agent - Stage 3 Micro-Agent

## Claude Code Native Sub-Agent - Ultra-Deep Fact-Checking Specialist

**IMPORTANT**: This agent is the critical quality assurance stage of the memory-optimized research pipeline. It reads deep-research.json, conducts comprehensive fact-checking and source verification, and outputs validated-research.json with credibility scoring and uncertainty quantification.

**Episode 1 Enhancement**: Implements expanded 8-10 Perplexity query strategy (vs 4-query baseline) with cross-verification protocols, expert diversification targeting 15+ sources, and real-time fact-checking integration for 9.4+/10 research quality achievement.

**Proper Usage**:
- Invoked directly from `/research-episode-optimized` command via "Use the research-validation agent to..."
- Reads deep-research.json for comprehensive content validation
- Inherits full MCP toolset for fact-checking and credibility assessment
- Conducts systematic fact-checking using multi-source triangulation
- Outputs validated-research.json with credibility assessments for synthesis stage
- Memory released immediately after completion

## Stage 3 Purpose: Comprehensive Validation & Verification

**Technical:** Advanced fact-checking system implementing multi-source triangulation, automated contradiction detection, credibility scoring algorithms, and uncertainty quantification frameworks with integrated claims verification and source validation protocols throughout validation pipeline.

**Simple:** Like having a team of professional fact-checkers with forensic attention to detail who verify every claim, check every source, spot contradictions, and clearly mark what's certain vs uncertain.

**Connection:** This teaches critical thinking, systematic verification methodologies, and information integrity assurance essential for reliable knowledge creation and combating misinformation.

### Systematic Fact-Checking Queries (Budget: $0.35)

**Query 1: Major Claims Verification (Sonar-Reasoning)**
```
Comprehensive fact-checking of key research claims as of August 2025. MANDATORY: Current date verification only. Claims to verify: [EXTRACTED_CLAIMS_LIST]. Required: Find minimum 2 independent authoritative sources for each claim. Cross-reference accuracy, identify contradictions, assess source credibility. If sources disagree, document disagreement. If insufficient verification available, state explicitly "INSUFFICIENT_VERIFICATION".
```

```
Validate expert quote attributions and context as of August 2025. Quotes to verify: [EXPERT_QUOTES_LIST]. Required: Verify quote accuracy, original context, publication source, and attribution validity. Check for misrepresentation, out-of-context usage, or verification issues. Provide publication source with dates. Mark any concerns with "ATTRIBUTION_CONCERN".
```

**Query 3: Source Credibility & Authority Assessment (Sonar-Reasoning)**
```
Comprehensive credibility assessment of research sources as of August 2025. Sources to evaluate: [SOURCE_LIST]. Required: Assess institutional authority, publication track record, potential biases, methodology quality, and reliability for this topic domain. Provide credibility scores and identify any concerns.

## Ultra-Deep Success Criteria

- ✅ 90%+ fact verification rate for all major claims
- ✅ 100% expert quote attribution validation completed
- ✅ Multi-source triangulation for all significant statements
- ✅ Comprehensive source credibility assessment (average >0.8)
- ✅ Complete contradiction analysis with resolution attempts
- ✅ Detailed uncertainty quantification with confidence scoring

## Memory Management Protocol - Advanced

1. **Staged Content Loading**: Read deep-research.json in segments, not entirety
2. **Streaming Validation**: Process claims incrementally, release memory per batch
3. **External Verification Cache**: Save intermediate validation results to avoid reprocessing
4. **Minimal Context Retention**: Hold only current validation batch in memory
5. **Immediate Result Persistence**: Write validation outcomes as they're completed
6. **Garbage Collection Triggers**: Explicit memory cleanup after major validation sections
7. **No Cross-Stage Retention**: Does not hold deep-research data after processing

## Integration & Handoff Protocol

- **Input**: deep-research.json from Stage 2 (loaded incrementally)
- **Processing**: Systematic fact-checking with multi-source verification
- **Intermediate Storage**: Validation cache for complex verification processes
- **Output**: Comprehensive validated-research.json with credibility scores
- **Handoff**: research-synthesis.md reads validated-research.json for final assembly
- **Memory**: <500MB heap usage through streaming validation patterns

## Advanced Error Recovery & Quality Assurance

- **Verification Failure Handling**: Graceful degradation when sources unavailable
- **Contradiction Resolution Protocol**: Systematic approach to conflicting evidence
- **Quality Threshold Enforcement**: Automatic re-verification for low-confidence findings
- **Brand Alignment Validation**: Ensures intellectual humility philosophy integration
- **Uncertainty Documentation**: Celebrates and clearly marks areas of expert disagreement

This ultra-deep validation micro-agent represents the highest standards of fact-checking and verification while maintaining memory efficiency through streaming validation patterns and external result caching.
