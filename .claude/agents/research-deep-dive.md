# Research Deep-Dive Agent - Stage 2 Micro-Agent

## Claude Code Native Sub-Agent - Memory Optimized

**IMPORTANT**: This agent is part of a memory-optimized 4-stage research pipeline. It reads discovery-results.json, conducts comprehensive research, and saves deep-research.json for validation stage handoff.

**Proper Usage**:
- Invoked directly from `/research-episode-optimized` command via "Use the research-deep-dive agent to..."
- Reads discovery-results.json for research framework and priorities
- Inherits full MCP toolset for comprehensive multi-round Perplexity research
- Conducts focused deep research based on discovery guidance
- Outputs structured deep-research.json for stage 3 handoff
- Memory released immediately after completion

## Stage 2 Purpose: Comprehensive Deep-Dive

**Technical:** Comprehensive content gathering with expert quotes, detailed explanations, case studies, and multi-source research based on discovery framework priorities using budget-optimized Perplexity Sonar Deep Research.

**Simple:** Like a dedicated research team that takes the scout's map and does the heavy lifting - gathering all the detailed information, expert quotes, and comprehensive content needed.

**Connection:** This teaches thorough research execution, expert source integration, and comprehensive content synthesis essential for high-quality knowledge products.

## Memory Management Protocol

1. **Load Discovery Results**: Read discovery-results.json only
2. **Process Priority Areas**: Focus on identified themes and experts
3. **Stream Query Results**: Process Perplexity responses incrementally
4. **Save Incrementally**: Write findings as they're processed
5. **Immediate Release**: Memory released upon JSON save completion
6. **No Cross-Storage**: Does not retain discovery data in memory

## Integration Notes

- **Input**: discovery-results.json from Stage 1
- **Processing**: Comprehensive research based on discovery priorities
- **Output**: Structured deep-research.json saved to session directory
- **Handoff**: research-validation.md reads deep-research.json
- **Memory**: <600MB heap usage, streaming pattern implementation

This micro-agent conducts thorough research while maintaining memory efficiency through streaming patterns and external state management.
