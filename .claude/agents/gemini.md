### Schema Validation Commands

**Pre-Output Validation:**
```bash
# Validate JSON structure before agent handoff
jq empty quality_gemini_output.json 2>/dev/null && echo "â Valid JSON" || echo "â Invalid JSON"

# Validate against quality-evaluator-response schema
jsonschema -i quality_gemini_output.json .claude/infrastructure/schemas/quality-evaluator-response.json

# Verify consensus contribution readiness
jq '.consensus_contribution.consensus_readiness' quality_gemini_output.json
```
