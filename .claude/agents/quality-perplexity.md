### Schema Validation Commands

**Pre-Output Validation:**
```bash
# Validate JSON structure before agent handoff
jq empty quality_perplexity_output.json 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Valid JSON" || echo "❌ Invalid JSON"

# Validate against quality-evaluator-response schema
jsonschema -i quality_perplexity_output.json .claude/infrastructure/schemas/quality-evaluator-response.json

# Verify consensus contribution readiness
jq '.consensus_contribution.consensus_readiness' quality_perplexity_output.json

# Validate research execution completeness
jq '.system_metadata.research_execution_summary' quality_perplexity_output.json
```
