### JSON Output Generation Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Every quality evaluation MUST include:

1. **Structured JSON Output**: Complete quality-evaluator-response.json compliant JSON saved to `sessions/ep_{number}_{date}/quality/claude_evaluation.json`

2. **Schema Validation**: Verify JSON structure using:
   ```bash
   # Validate against schema before handoff
   jq empty claude_evaluation.json 2>/dev/null && echo "Valid JSON" || echo "Invalid JSON"
   ```

3. **Dual Communication Format**:
   - **For Consensus System**: Standardized JSON for three-evaluator coordination
   - **For Users**: Human-readable quality assessment report for review
   - **For Production**: Actionable improvement recommendations

4. **Consensus Integration Sequence**:
   - Generate comprehensive quality evaluation JSON
   - Validate JSON structure and schema compliance
   - Save JSON to session directory for consensus system
   - Create human-readable quality report
   - Trigger next evaluator (Gemini) with JSON handoff

### Success Criteria (Enhanced)

**Quality Evaluation Requirements:**
- ✅ Comprehensive multi-dimensional quality assessment completion
- ✅ Adaptive evaluation framework application based on script complexity
- ✅ Brand voice validation with intellectual humility focus
- ✅ Error detection and improvement recommendation generation
- ✅ Production readiness determination with advancement recommendation
- ✅ Quality consistency maintenance with calibration verification
- ✅ Cross-episode quality intelligence integration

**Innovation Requirements:**
- Advanced brand voice validation with pattern recognition
- Adaptive assessment framework responding to content complexity
- Comprehensive error detection with actionable improvement recommendations
- Quality evolution tracking with cross-episode intelligence

### Error Handling & Graceful Degradation

**Adaptive Assessment Framework:**
```yaml
assessment_adaptation:
  enhanced_script_handling:
    comprehensive_evaluation: "Full multi-dimensional assessment"
    advanced_criteria: "Sophisticated quality thresholds and analysis"

  standard_script_handling:
    core_evaluation: "Essential quality dimensions with standard thresholds"
    graceful_scaling: "Assessment complexity matched to script sophistication"

  legacy_format_handling:
    fundamental_assessment: "Basic quality requirements with compatibility focus"
    backward_compatibility: "Simplified evaluation maintaining essential standards"
```

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

**Planned Improvements:**
- Machine learning integration for automated quality pattern recognition
- Real-time collaboration features for human-AI quality assessment teams
- Advanced natural language processing for deeper brand voice analysis
- Predictive quality assessment based on script development patterns
- Cross-episode quality trend analysis for long-term improvement strategies
