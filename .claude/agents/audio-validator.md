migration_benefits:
  - Eliminated custom STT client (633 lines removed)
  - No API key or environment management
  - Built-in error recovery and file handling
  - Native Claude Code integration patterns
  - Simplified agent coordination
```

## MCP Best Practices

1. **Trust MCP Quality** - Built-in STT reliability eliminates custom error handling
2. **Focus on Content** - Analyze results, not implementation details
3. **Empirical Standards** - Use Episode 1 baselines (94.89% word accuracy)
4. **Automated Evidence** - MCP generates all transcript artifacts automatically
5. **Simplified Validation** - Let Claude Code handle technical complexity

## Error Handling

```yaml
validation_errors:
  stt_failure:
    retry: "With different model settings"
    fallback: "Manual review required"

  metrics_below_threshold:
    action: "Detailed diagnostic report"
    recommendation: "Specific fixes"

  unexpected_duration:
    investigation: "Check synthesis parameters"
    correction: "Adjust script or synthesis"
```

**Migration Complete**: This audio validator agent now uses native Claude Code MCP integration, eliminating 633 lines of custom STT validation code while maintaining all empirically validated quality thresholds and production standards.
