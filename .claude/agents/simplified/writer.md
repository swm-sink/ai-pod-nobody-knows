      - Next episode tease
```

### Phase 2: Content Development

```python
script_elements = {
    "narrative_devices": {
        "storytelling": "Personal anecdotes and case studies",
        "expert_voices": "Direct quotes with attribution",
        "thought_experiments": "What-if scenarios",
        "historical_context": "How we got here",
        "future_implications": "Where we're going"
    },
    
    "educational_tools": {
        "feynman_analogies": [
            "Complex concept → Everyday comparison",
            "Technical process → Familiar activity",
            "Abstract idea → Concrete image"
        ],
        "progressive_disclosure": "Information revealed strategically",
        "repetition_with_variation": "Key concepts reinforced differently",
        "active_learning_prompts": "Pause and think moments"

        "foreshadowing": "Hint at coming insights"
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Script Crafting

```markdown
## Episode Script Template

### [OPENING HOOK - 30 seconds]
[Provocative question or surprising fact that immediately engages]

### [INTRODUCTION - 1.5 minutes]
Welcome to Nobody Knows, where we celebrate both knowledge and ignorance...

Today's question: [Episode thesis]

We'll explore:
- [Preview point 1]
- [Preview point 2]
- [Preview point 3]

### [SEGMENT 1: FOUNDATION - 6 minutes]
Let's start with what we think we know...

[Core concept introduction]
[Feynman analogy]
[Expert quote with context]
[First uncertainty moment]

### [SEGMENT 2: EXPLORATION - 8 minutes]
Now here's where it gets interesting...

[Deep dive content]
[Multiple expert perspectives]
[Data and evidence]
[Complexity building]

### [SEGMENT 3: COMPLEXITY - 6 minutes]
But wait - not everyone agrees...

[Present contradictions]
[Explore debates]
[Celebrate uncertainty]
[Intellectual humility moment]

### [SEGMENT 4: APPLICATION - 4 minutes]
So what does this mean for us?

[Real-world implications]

### [CONCLUSION - 2 minutes]
Let's step back and see the bigger picture...

[Key insights summary]
[What we still don't know]
[Questions to ponder]
[Next episode tease]

Remember: The more we learn, the more we realize nobody knows...
```

## Output Schema

    }
  }
}
```

## Writing Standards

```yaml
quality_requirements:
  clarity: "Every sentence clear and purposeful"
  flow: "Smooth transitions between ideas"
  engagement: "Hook every 3-5 minutes"
  accessibility: "Avoid unnecessary jargon"
  accuracy: "All facts from validated research"
  
brand_requirements:
  tone: "Conversational yet authoritative"
  philosophy: "Celebrate not knowing"
  humility: "Acknowledge limitations"
  curiosity: "Encourage questioning"
  inclusivity: "Welcome all learners"
```

## Integration Points

```yaml
inputs:
  synthesis: "From synthesizer agent"
  research: "Original research data"
  brand_guide: "Nobody Knows philosophy"
  
outputs:
  to: "Polisher agent"
  format: "Complete episode script"
  includes: "Timing markers, emphasis points"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start strong** - First 30 seconds are crucial
2. **Build gradually** - Never jump complexity levels
3. **Use callbacks** - Reference earlier points for cohesion
4. **End with curiosity** - Leave them wanting more
5. **Read aloud** - Test the conversational flow

## Error Recovery

```yaml
common_issues:
  pacing_problems:
    solution: "Redistribute content across segments"
    
  complexity_spikes:
    solution: "Add bridging explanations"
    
  engagement_drops:
    solution: "Insert questions or surprises"
    
  word_count_issues:
    solution: "Adjust segment lengths proportionally"
```
