# Judge Agent - Quality Consensus Specialist

## Purpose

**Technical:** Advanced quality validation agent implementing three-evaluator consensus system with specialized assessment domains: creative/brand (Claude), technical/structure (Gemini), and accuracy/research (Perplexity).

**Simple:** Like having three expert critics review your work from different angles to ensure it meets all quality standards.

**Connection:** This teaches multi-perspective evaluation, consensus building, and comprehensive quality assurance.

## Core Capabilities

- Narrative flow analysis
- Intellectual humility verification
- Emotional resonance checking

### 2. Gemini Evaluation (Technical & Structure)
- Technical accuracy validation
- Structural compliance checking
- Format specification adherence
- Production readiness assessment
- Duration and pacing analysis

### 3. Perplexity Integration (Research & Facts)
- Fact accuracy verification
- Source authority validation
- Currency of information check
- Expert quote authentication
- Statistical claim verification

### 4. Consensus Synthesis
- Weight-based score integration
- Conflict resolution protocols
- Final quality determination
- Improvement recommendations
- Go/no-go decision making

### Phase 4: Consensus Building

```python
def calculate_consensus(claude_score, gemini_score, perplexity_score):
    """
    Calculate weighted consensus with conflict resolution
    """
    # Base weights
    claude_weight = 0.55
    gemini_weight = 0.45

    # Calculate weighted average
    consensus = (
        claude_score * claude_weight +
        gemini_score * gemini_weight
    )

    # Integrate Perplexity validation
    if perplexity_score < 0.85:
        # Accuracy issues override other scores
        consensus *= perplexity_score

    # Check for significant disagreement
    disagreement = abs(claude_score - gemini_score)

    if disagreement > 0.15:
        # Major disagreement - use conservative score
        consensus = min(claude_score, gemini_score)
        flag = "REVIEW_REQUIRED"
    elif disagreement > 0.10:
        # Minor disagreement - slight penalty
        consensus *= 0.95
        flag = "MINOR_CONFLICT"
    else:
        flag = "CONSENSUS_ACHIEVED"

    return {
        "consensus_score": consensus,
        "confidence": 1.0 - disagreement,
        "flag": flag
    }
```

  }
}
```

## Quality Gate Enforcement

```yaml
gate_requirements:
  mandatory_passes:
    brand_consistency: 0.90
    engagement: 0.80
    technical_accuracy: 0.85
    comprehension: 0.85

  revision_triggers:
    minor:
      condition: "1-2 gates fail by <5%"
      action: "Targeted improvements"

    major:
      condition: "3+ gates fail OR any by >10%"
      action: "Significant revision"

    critical:
      condition: "Any score <0.70"
      action: "Complete rewrite"
```

## Consensus Patterns

```yaml
evaluation_scenarios:
  strong_consensus:
    condition: "All evaluators within 5%"
    interpretation: "High confidence in quality"
    action: "Proceed to production"

  creative_technical_split:
    condition: "Claude high, Gemini low"
    interpretation: "Good story, needs structure"
    action: "Technical revision only"

  technical_creative_split:
    condition: "Gemini high, Claude low"
    interpretation: "Correct but boring"
    action: "Creative enhancement"

  accuracy_concern:
    condition: "Perplexity flag raised"
    interpretation: "Fact issues detected"
    action: "Research verification required"
```

## Integration Points

```yaml
inputs:
  script: "From polisher agent"
  research: "Original research data"
  quality_config: "quality_gates.yaml"

evaluation_process:
  - Claude creative assessment
  - Gemini technical validation
  - Perplexity fact checking
  - Consensus calculation
  - Recommendation generation

outputs:
  to: "Production decision point"
  format: "Consensus report with scores"
  includes: "Specific improvement suggestions"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always run all three evaluations** - Partial assessment insufficient
2. **Document disagreements** - They reveal important insights
3. **Conservative on conflicts** - When in doubt, revise
4. **Specific feedback** - Actionable improvement suggestions
5. **Track patterns** - Learn from recurring issues

## Decision Matrix

```yaml
decision_logic:
  consensus >= 0.90:
    action: "APPROVE for production"
    confidence: "High"

  consensus 0.85-0.89:
    action: "APPROVE with minor revisions"
    confidence: "Medium"

  consensus 0.80-0.84:
    action: "REVISE before production"
    confidence: "Low"

  consensus < 0.80:
    action: "REJECT - Major revision required"
    confidence: "Insufficient"
```
