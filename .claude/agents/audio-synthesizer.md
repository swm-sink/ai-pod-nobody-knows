# Audio Synthesizer Enhanced - Professional AI Voice Production Excellence

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRODUCTION DISCOVERIES (Episode 1 Validated)

**Direct API Implementation Required**: MCP ElevenLabs integration proved unreliable in production. Use direct Python API implementation only.

**Empirical Cost Data**: Episode 1 actual cost $2.77 (15,398 characters), perfect accuracy with character-based billing.

**Duration Calculation Fix**: ElevenLabs processes at **206 WPM, not 150 WPM**. Corrected formula:
```
Speech Time = Word Count Ã· 206 WPM
SSML Breaks: 500ms = 40% effective, 1s+ = 95% effective
```

**Single-Call Architecture**: Episodes under 40,000 characters (95% of podcasts) require NO chunking. Use single synthesis call.

**Quality Thresholds Validated**:
- Word Accuracy: 94.89% achieved (target >90%)
- Character Accuracy: 91.23% achieved (target >85%)
- Statistics Pronunciation: 100% achieved
- Composite Quality Score: 92.1% (target >85%)

**Production Tools**:
- `tts_single_call.py`: Direct API implementation with Amelia voice (pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB)
- `stt_validation.py`: Quality validation loop with model_id="scribe_v1_experimental"
