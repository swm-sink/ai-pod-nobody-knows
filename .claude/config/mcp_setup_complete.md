✅
Removed Atlassian MCP (not needed for this project)
Installed Official MCPs Locally
✅

Perplexity MCP (Node.js-based) in .claude/mcp-servers/perplexity-mcp/
Security Implementation
✅
Added to .gitignore (won't be committed)
API keys stored securely
Created .mcp.json.example for others
Configuration Files
✅
Your actual configuration (git-ignored)
Template for others (safe to commit)
Testing
✅
Both MCP modules load successfully
Configuration file valid
API keys properly set
To Activate MCPs in Claude Code:
Option 1: Restart Claude Code (Recommended)
# The .mcp.json in project root will be automatically loaded
# Just restart Claude Code and the MCPs should be available
Option 2: Manual Reload (if needed)
# From project directory
cd /Users/smenssink/Documents/GitHub/ai-podcasts-nobody-knows
# Check if MCPs are loaded
claude mcp list
# If not showing, may need to restart Claude Code application

Testing Your Setup:
# Test MCPs are working
python3 .claude/scripts/test_mcps.py
# After Claude Code restart, verify MCPs available
claude mcp list
.mcp.json is git-ignored
.claude/mcp-servers/ is git-ignored
API keys are never hardcoded
Example files don't contain real keys
No Atlassian MCP in this project

-
    Restart Claude Code to load the MCPs

-
    Verify with `claude mcp list`

-
    Start using in your agents:
Research agent can use Perplexity
Audio agent can use ElevenLabs
Script/Quality use native Claude Code
If MCPs don't appear after restart:

-
      Check you're in project directory

-
      Verify .mcp.json exists in project root

-
      Check API keys are correct

-
      Look at Claude Code logs for errors
Ready for use after Claude Code restart
