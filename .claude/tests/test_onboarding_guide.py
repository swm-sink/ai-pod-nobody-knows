Test suite for non-technical getting started guide
Test-Driven Development for Task DOC-002

Test Strategy:
Given: Need non-technical onboarding guide with 15-minute completion target
When: Guide is created following progressive disclosure principles
Then: Guide has 8th-grade reading level, clear steps, and success validation
Because: 62.5% user drop-off must be reduced through better onboarding
