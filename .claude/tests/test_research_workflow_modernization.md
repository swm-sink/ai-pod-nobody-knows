# Research Workflow Command Modernization Tests

## Test Requirements (2024-2025 Patterns)

### RED PHASE: Failing Tests for Modern Integration

#### Test 1: Modernized Agent Invocation
**Expected:** Command should use proper $ARGUMENTS syntax for all three agents
**Current:** Command uses descriptive text instead of actual agent invocations
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 2: Enhanced Data Flow Integration
**Expected:** Command should handle enhanced output schemas from modernized agents
**Current:** Command expects old schema formats (research_findings.json vs research_package.json)
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 3: Interactive Confirmation Coordination
**Expected:** Command should gracefully handle interactive agent confirmation loops
**Current:** No handling of user confirmations required by modernized agents
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 4: Progress Coordination
**Expected:** Command should show workflow progress while agents show individual progress
**Current:** No coordination between command-level and agent-level progress tracking
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 5: Quality Gate Integration
**Expected:** Command should integrate with modernized synthesizer quality validation
**Current:** Basic quality requirements without modernized agent integration
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 6: Error Recovery Enhancement
**Expected:** Command should handle enhanced agent error recovery patterns
**Current:** Basic retry strategy without modern error handling integration
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

## Agent Integration Requirements

### Agent Sequence and Data Flow
```yaml
research_pipeline:
  step_1:
    agent: researcher
    invocation: 'Use the researcher agent to investigate "$ARGUMENTS"'
    input: "Episode topic and research requirements"
    output: "research_package.json"
    
  step_2:
    agent: fact-checker  
    invocation: 'Use the fact-checker agent to verify "$ARGUMENTS"'
    input: "research_package.json from step 1"
    output: "validation_report.json"
    
  step_3:
    agent: synthesizer
    invocation: 'Use the synthesizer agent to synthesize "$ARGUMENTS"'
    input: "research_package.json and validation_report.json"
    output: "synthesis_package.json"
```

### Interactive Pattern Integration
```yaml
confirmation_handling:
  researcher_confirmations:
    - "Research scope and complexity confirmation"
    - "Cost estimation approval for MCP queries"
    
  fact_checker_confirmations:
    - "Verification scope and threshold confirmation" 
    - "Ambiguous claim resolution decisions"
    
  synthesizer_confirmations:
    - "Narrative strategy and complexity confirmation"
    - "Brand emphasis and intellectual humility frequency"
```

## Expected Modernization Improvements

After modernization, the command should:
1. Use proper $ARGUMENTS agent invocation syntax throughout
2. Handle enhanced output schemas with reasoning traces
3. Coordinate interactive confirmation loops gracefully
4. Show coordinated progress indicators across all three agents
5. Integrate quality gates with modernized agent capabilities
6. Handle enhanced error recovery with user option selection
7. Maintain all existing research workflow functionality
8. Follow 2024-2025 Claude Code command patterns

## Quality Validation Criteria

### Functional Tests
- [x] Command properly invokes researcher agent with $ARGUMENTS
- [x] Command properly invokes fact-checker agent with research output
- [x] Command properly invokes synthesizer agent with validated data
- [x] Command handles enhanced output schemas correctly
- [x] Command coordinates interactive confirmations
- [x] Command shows workflow progress coordination

### Integration Tests
- [x] Research pipeline produces complete synthesis_package.json
- [x] Quality standards maintained throughout workflow
- [x] Cost tracking and budget management functional
- [x] Error recovery patterns properly integrated
- [x] Session management and state preservation working

### Performance Tests
- [x] Workflow completes within expected time (5-10 minutes)
- [x] Cost remains within budget ($1-2 target)
- [x] Quality metrics meet or exceed standards
- [x] User experience smooth with proper confirmations

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Pre-Test:** Document current research-workflow behavior
2. **RED Phase:** Verify tests fail against current implementation
3. **GREEN Phase:** Implement minimal changes to pass tests
4. **REFACTOR Phase:** Optimize while maintaining test passage
5. **Validation:** Confirm all quality metrics maintained
6. **Integration:** Test with modernized agents end-to-end
