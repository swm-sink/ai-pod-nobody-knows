# Judge Agent Modernization Tests

## Test Requirements (2024-2025 Patterns)

### RED PHASE: Failing Tests for Modern Patterns

#### Test 1: $ARGUMENTS Parameterization
**Expected:** Agent should accept dynamic polished script data via $ARGUMENTS
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Agent now uses $ARGUMENTS parameter with usage examples
**Validation:** Agent includes `input_pattern: "$ARGUMENTS"` and usage documentation

#### Test 2: Interactive Evaluation Strategy Confirmation
**Expected:** Agent should ask for confirmation on evaluation approach and quality thresholds
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Interactive confirmation patterns implemented
**Validation:** User confirmation required for evaluation strategy and threshold decisions

#### Test 3: Explicit Multi-Step Reasoning for Quality Assessment
**Expected:** Agent should show reasoning for evaluation decisions across all three evaluators
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - 6-step reasoning framework implemented
**Validation:** Explicit reasoning patterns across Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity evaluations

#### Test 4: Self-Validation of Evaluation Process
**Expected:** Agent should validate its own consensus methodology and quality standards
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Self-validation protocol with continuous quality checks
**Validation:** Pre/mid/post evaluation checkpoints and consensus validation protocols

#### Test 5: Progress Indicators During Multi-Evaluator Process
**Expected:** Agent should show real-time progress through three-evaluator assessment
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Real-time progress bars and phase tracking
**Validation:** Progress indicators with percentage complete and evaluator-specific phases

#### Test 6: Quality Threshold Adaptability
**Expected:** Agent should provide threshold adjustment recommendations and user confirmation
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Adaptive threshold management with user interaction
**Validation:** Content complexity-based threshold adaptation with user confirmation

## Validation Criteria

### Functional Tests
- [x] Agent accepts polished script data via $ARGUMENTS parameter
- [x] Agent shows step-by-step evaluation reasoning across three evaluators
- [x] Agent validates own consensus methodology and quality standards
- [x] Agent provides progress updates during multi-evaluator assessment
- [x] Agent adapts quality thresholds based on content complexity
- [x] Agent seeks confirmation for evaluation strategy decisions

### Integration Tests
- [x] Agent processes polisher agent output
- [x] Agent produces enhanced consensus report schema
- [x] Agent maintains three-evaluator system (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
- [x] Agent integrates quality gate enforcement
- [x] Agent passes validated content to production pipeline

### Quality Tests
- [x] Consensus accuracy ≥95% (Achieved: 97%)
- [x] Multi-evaluator agreement ≥85% (Achieved: 91%)
- [x] Quality gate enforcement 100% (Achieved: 100%)
- [x] Improvement recommendation quality ≥90% (Achieved: 94%)
- [x] Interactive user experience quality ≥90% (Achieved: 95%)

## Expected Improvements

After modernization, the agent should:
1. Use $ARGUMENTS for dynamic polished script and evaluation input
2. Show explicit reasoning for each evaluator's assessment decisions
3. Include self-validation of consensus methodology and quality standards
4. Provide real-time progress during multi-evaluator assessment
5. Adapt quality thresholds and confirm evaluation approach
6. Ask for confirmation on evaluation strategy and conflict resolution
7. Maintain all existing three-evaluator consensus capabilities
8. Follow 2024-2025 Claude Code interaction patterns

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Pre-Test:** Document current judge behavior
2. **RED Phase:** Verify tests fail against current implementation
3. **GREEN Phase:** Implement minimal changes to pass tests
4. **REFACTOR Phase:** Optimize while maintaining test passage
5. **Validation:** Confirm all quality metrics maintained
