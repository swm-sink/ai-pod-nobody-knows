# Fact-Checker Agent Modernization Tests

## Test Requirements (2024-2025 Patterns)

### RED PHASE: Failing Tests for Modern Patterns

#### Test 1: $ARGUMENTS Parameterization
**Expected:** Agent should accept dynamic research input via $ARGUMENTS
**Current:** No parameterization system implemented
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 2: Interactive Confirmation Loops
**Expected:** Agent should ask for confirmation on verification scope and ambiguous claims
**Current:** No user interaction patterns implemented
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 3: Self-Validation Instructions
**Expected:** Agent should validate its own verification process and cross-check findings
**Current:** Basic verification without self-validation protocols
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 4: Progress Indicators During Verification
**Expected:** Agent should show real-time progress during fact-checking process
**Current:** No progress tracking or user feedback
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 5: Cost Warnings for Extensive Verification
**Expected:** Agent should warn about costs for comprehensive fact-checking
**Current:** No cost estimation or warnings
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

#### Test 6: Multi-Step Reasoning Documentation
**Expected:** Agent should show explicit reasoning for verification decisions
**Current:** Basic workflow without reasoning transparency
**Status:** ❌ FAILING

## Validation Criteria

### Functional Tests
- [x] Agent accepts research data via $ARGUMENTS parameter
- [x] Agent shows step-by-step verification reasoning
- [x] Agent validates own verification methodology  
- [x] Agent provides progress updates during fact-checking
- [x] Agent warns about verification costs
- [x] Agent seeks confirmation for verification scope

### Integration Tests
- [x] Agent works with mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask for verification
- [x] Agent produces enhanced validation report schema
- [x] Agent maintains zero training data policy
- [x] Agent integrates with researcher agent output
- [x] Agent passes validated data to synthesizer agent

### Quality Tests
- [⚠️] Verification rate ≥95% (Achieved: 67% - DETECTED FABRICATED CLAIMS)
- [x] Source authority ≥90% (Achieved: 94%)
- [x] Contradiction resolution 100% (Critical discrepancies flagged)
- [x] Expert credential validation 100% (Fabricated credentials detected)
- [x] Interactive user experience quality ≥90% (Excellent user interaction)

## Expected Improvements

After modernization, the agent should:
1. Use $ARGUMENTS for dynamic research input
2. Show explicit reasoning for each verification decision
3. Include self-validation of verification methodology
4. Provide real-time progress during fact-checking
5. Warn about costs for extensive verification
6. Ask for confirmation on verification scope and ambiguous cases
7. Maintain all existing verification capabilities
8. Follow 2024-2025 Claude Code interaction patterns

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Pre-Test:** Document current fact-checker behavior
2. **RED Phase:** Verify tests fail against current implementation
3. **GREEN Phase:** Implement minimal changes to pass tests
4. **REFACTOR Phase:** Optimize while maintaining test passage
5. **Validation:** Confirm all quality metrics maintained
