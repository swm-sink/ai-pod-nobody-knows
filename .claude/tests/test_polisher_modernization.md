# Polisher Agent Modernization Tests

## Test Requirements (2024-2025 Patterns)

### RED PHASE: Failing Tests for Modern Patterns

#### Test 1: $ARGUMENTS Parameterization
**Expected:** Agent should accept dynamic script data via $ARGUMENTS
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Agent now uses $ARGUMENTS parameter with usage examples
**Validation:** Agent includes `input_pattern: "$ARGUMENTS"` and usage documentation

#### Test 2: Interactive SSML Strategy Confirmation
**Expected:** Agent should ask for confirmation on optimization approach and complexity level
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Interactive confirmation patterns implemented
**Validation:** User confirmation required for TTS strategy and voice tuning decisions

#### Test 3: Explicit Multi-Step Reasoning for SSML Optimization
**Expected:** Agent should show reasoning for TTS optimization decisions
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - 6-step reasoning framework implemented
**Validation:** Explicit reasoning patterns with step-by-step optimization development

#### Test 4: Self-Validation of TTS Optimization
**Expected:** Agent should validate its own SSML markup and brand alignment
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Self-validation protocol with continuous quality checks
**Validation:** Pre/mid/post optimization checkpoints and validation protocols

#### Test 5: Progress Indicators During Polish Process
**Expected:** Agent should show real-time progress through optimization phases
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Real-time progress bars and phase tracking
**Validation:** Progress indicators with percentage complete and phase descriptions

#### Test 6: Cost Awareness for SSML Complexity
**Expected:** Agent should provide complexity estimates for TTS optimization
**Implementation:** ✅ PASSING - Complexity estimation and time confirmation
**Validation:** Pre-optimization complexity warnings with time estimates

## Expected Improvements

After modernization, the agent should:
1. Use $ARGUMENTS for dynamic script and optimization input
2. Show explicit reasoning for SSML optimization decisions
3. Include self-validation of TTS quality and brand alignment
4. Provide real-time progress during multi-phase optimization
5. Estimate complexity and confirm optimization approach
6. Ask for confirmation on TTS strategy and voice settings
7. Maintain all existing SSML and polish capabilities
8. Follow 2024-2025 Claude Code interaction patterns

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Pre-Test:** Document current polisher behavior
2. **RED Phase:** Verify tests fail against current implementation
3. **GREEN Phase:** Implement minimal changes to pass tests
4. **REFACTOR Phase:** Optimize while maintaining test passage
5. **Validation:** Confirm all quality metrics maintained
