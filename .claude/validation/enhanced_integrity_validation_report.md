- **TTS Optimization:** Validates audio tags, optimization ratios, voice model selection
- **Audio Synthesis:** Validates duration, voice consistency, file integrity

#### 3. Dependency Chain Validation ✅
- **Dependency Mapping:** Each checkpoint validates its required dependencies exist
- **Completion Status:** Dependencies must have "completed" status before dependent checkpoints
- **Chain Integrity:** Validates logical progression through pipeline stages
- **Error Detection:** Identifies missing or incomplete dependency chains

#### 4. Cross-Checkpoint Consistency Validation ✅
- **Session ID Consistency:** All checkpoints must have matching session IDs
- **Episode Number Consistency:** All checkpoints must reference same episode
- **Timestamp Sequence:** Validates logical temporal progression

Cost protected: $9.50
INTEGRITY STATUS: PARTIAL
```

**Detailed Findings:**

#### ✅ Valid Checkpoints
1. **Deep Research (01_deep_research_complete.json)**: $7.50 protected
   - JSON structure: ✅ Valid
   - Dependencies: ✅ No dependencies required
   - Content warnings: ⚠️ Test data contains zeros (expected for test data)

2. **Questions (02_questions_complete.json)**: $0.50 protected
   - JSON structure: ✅ Valid
   - Dependencies: ✅ Research checkpoint validated
   - Content integrity: ✅ Valid

3. **Script (05_script_complete.json)**: $1.50 protected
   - JSON structure: ✅ Valid
   - Dependencies: ✅ Planning checkpoint validated
   - Content warnings: ⚠️ Duration estimate zero (acceptable for test data)

#### ❌ Invalid Checkpoints (Test Data Issues)
1. **Synthesis (03_synthesis_complete.json)**:
   - Issue: ❌ Insufficient research calls: 0 (expected ≥100)
   - Reason: Test data contains placeholder values

2. **Planning (04_planning_complete.json)**:
   - Issue: ❌ Incorrect duration target: "47:00" (expected: "47+ minutes")
   - Reason: Format mismatch in test data

#### ✅ Cross-Checkpoint Validation
- **Session ID Consistency:** ✅ All checkpoints match session ID
- **Timestamp Sequence:** ✅ Logical progression validated
- **Dependency Chain:** ✅ All present dependencies satisfied
