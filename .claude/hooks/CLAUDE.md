## üéØ HOOKS AUTOMATION CONTEXT

**Technical:** Hook system memory implementing event-driven automation, cost tracking, session lifecycle management, error recovery protocols, and system reliability patterns for robust podcast production operations.

**Simple:** Like having automatic systems that watch over your work, track costs, handle errors, and keep everything running smoothly without you having to think about it.

**Connection:** This teaches event-driven architecture, automation patterns, and reliability engineering essential for production AI systems.

## ü™ù HOOK ARCHITECTURE

### **Simplified Hook System** - `@simplified/`

### **Pre-Tool Validation** - `@simplified/pre-tool-validation.sh`
<LOAD_IF task="validation|cost|budget|pre-check">
Budget validation and cost control before expensive operations
</LOAD_IF>

### **Post-Tool Tracking** - `@simplified/post-tool-tracking.sh`
<LOAD_IF task="tracking|cost|attribution|monitoring">
Cost attribution and real-time spending monitoring
</LOAD_IF>

### **Session Lifecycle** - `@simplified/session-lifecycle.sh`
<LOAD_IF task="session|lifecycle|initialization|cleanup">
Session initialization, state management, and cleanup automation
</LOAD_IF>

### **Error Recovery** - `@error-recovery.sh`
<LOAD_IF task="error|recovery|reliability|debugging">
Error detection, recovery protocols, and system reliability
</LOAD_IF>

## ‚ö° AUTOMATION PATTERNS

### **Cost Control Automation**
```yaml
budget_enforcement:
  pre_validation:
    trigger: "Before any API operation"
    checks: ["current spend vs budget", "operation cost estimate"]
    actions: ["warn at 80%", "require approval at 95%", "block at 100%"]
    
  post_tracking:
    trigger: "After any API operation"
    records: ["actual cost", "operation type", "timestamp"]
    updates: ["running totals", "budget remaining", "trend analysis"]
    
real_time_monitoring:
  cost_attribution: "Per-operation cost tracking"
  budget_warnings: "Immediate alerts when approaching limits"
  trend_analysis: "Predictive spending pattern analysis"
```

### **Session Management Automation**
```yaml
lifecycle_automation:
  session_init:
    trigger: "/init command or workflow start"
    actions: ["create state file", "initialize cost tracking", "setup recovery"]
    
  checkpoint_creation:
    trigger: "End of each workflow phase"
    actions: ["save state", "backup progress", "cost snapshot"]
    
  session_cleanup:
    trigger: "Session completion or timeout"
    actions: ["archive state", "final cost report", "cleanup temp files"]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è RELIABILITY ENGINEERING

### **Error Recovery Patterns**
- **Automatic Retry**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **State Recovery**: Restore from last successful checkpoint
- **Cost Protection**: Never retry expensive operations without approval
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback strategies for component failures

### **System Health Monitoring**
- **Hook Execution**: All hooks log execution status and timing
- **Cost Trending**: Real-time analysis of spending patterns
- **Error Rates**: Automated tracking of failure frequencies
- **Performance Metrics**: Hook execution efficiency monitoring
