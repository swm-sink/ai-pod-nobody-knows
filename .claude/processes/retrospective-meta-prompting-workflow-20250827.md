    enforcement: "Block new context file creation if limit exceeded"
    rationale: "User cannot navigate 35+ files effectively"

  single_source_truth:
    new_rule: "Each topic covered in exactly one context file"
    enforcement: "Pre-commit hooks detect topic duplication across files"
    rationale: "Multiple files on same topic create maintenance burden"

  automated_maintenance: "Periodic context file usage audits and cleanup"
```

### ASSESSMENT CONCLUSION

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Current 255-file documentation system is operationally dysfunctional for user navigation and maintenance.

**REQUIRED ACTION**: Immediate reduction to maximum 15 context files with strict governance enforcement.

**CONTEXT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL**: Implement automatic enforcement preventing future documentation sprawl while preserving all operational knowledge through systematic consolidation.

This assessment assumes user will not manually review documentation and provides autonomous evaluation with specific enforcement mechanisms to prevent future context management violations.
