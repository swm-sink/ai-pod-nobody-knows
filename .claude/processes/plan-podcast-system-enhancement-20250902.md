## 2. Architecture Design

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### ADR-001: Documentation Architecture - Progressive Disclosure Pattern
**Context:** Need dual-audience documentation for technical and non-technical users  
**Decision:** Implement layered documentation with audience-specific entry points  
**Rationale:** Research shows "AI-assisted content adaptation" as 2025 primary trend  
**Consequences:** Requires initial investment but enables self-service onboarding

#### ADR-002: Security Architecture - HashiCorp Vault Integration  
**Context:** Environment variables pose critical security vulnerability  
**Decision:** Migrate to HashiCorp Vault Community Edition for secret management  
**Rationale:** Research indicates "environment variables are deprecated for production AI systems"  
**Consequences:** $5-10/month hosting cost but eliminates critical security risk

#### ADR-003: State Management - Schema Versioning Implementation
**Context:** Missing state versioning creates migration and recovery risks  
**Decision:** Add `_schema_version` field to PodcastState with validation  
**Rationale:** Research shows "state versioning essential for production workflows"  
**Consequences:** Enables safe state evolution and system upgrades
