## Deployment Configuration Documentation

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT SETUP
Environment Variables: ✅ Configured in .env (3 API keys validated)
Startup Script: ✅ start-claude.sh (executable and functional)
API Key Lengths: ✅ ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (51 chars), PERPLEXITY_API_KEY (53 chars)
MCP Permissions: ✅ 22 ElevenLabs tools configured in settings.json
```

### Production Voice Configuration
```json
{
  "production_voice": {
    "voice_id": "ZF6FPAbjXT4488VcRRnw",
    "voice_name": "Amelia",
    "governance": {
      "immutable_without_user_permission": true,
      "production_critical": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Cost Control Configuration
```yaml
budget_framework:
  total_episode_budget: "$15.00 (with $5.51 optimization target)"
  enhanced_tracking: "Real-time monitoring via post/pre-tool hooks"
  phase_allocation:
    research: "$2.50 (17%)"
    script: "$1.75 (12%)"

    audio: "$7.25 (48%)"
    validation: "$1.00 (7%)"
    packaging: "$0.25 (2%)"
```

## Runtime Validation Requirements

### Critical Deployment Dependency
**BLOCKING ISSUE**: Current Claude Code session lacks proper environment variable loading
**RESOLUTION**: Must restart Claude Code with `./start-claude.sh` before production validation
**EVIDENCE**: ElevenLabs MCP tools return 401 errors (authentication failure)

### Post-Restart Validation Sequence
1. **MCP Authentication Test**: `mcp__elevenlabs__check_subscription` should return data
2. **Production Voice Validation**: Confirm access to ZF6FPAbjXT4488VcRRnw
3. **Agent MCP Inheritance**: Verify sub-agents can access inherited MCP tools
4. **Production Pipeline Test**: Execute complete episode generation
