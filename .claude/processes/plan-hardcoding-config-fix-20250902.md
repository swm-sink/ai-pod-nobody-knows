## 1. Evidence-Based Requirements Framework

### Requirements Traceability Matrix
| Requirement | Source | Priority | Success Criteria |
|-------------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **REQ-1:** Fix voice ID hardcoding | Pre-commit hook failure | Must-Have | Zero hardcoded voice IDs detected |
| **REQ-2:** Root directory cleanup | Governance violation (34→8 files) | Must-Have | ≤8 files in root directory |
| **REQ-3:** Centralized configuration | Research best practices | Should-Have | Pydantic Settings implementation |
| **REQ-4:** Pre-commit compliance | Development workflow | Must-Have | All governance hooks pass |
| **REQ-5:** Professional structure | Enterprise standards | Should-Have | src layout implementation |

### MoSCoW Prioritization Analysis
**MUST HAVE (Blocking Issues):**
- Voice ID hardcoding elimination (blocks all commits)
- Root directory governance compliance (blocks deployment)
- Pre-commit hook satisfaction (blocks development workflow)

**SHOULD HAVE (Quality Improvements):**
- Centralized configuration management architecture
- Professional directory structure (src layout)
- Enhanced governance automation

**COULD HAVE (Future Enhancements):**
- Cloud secrets management integration
- Dynamic configuration reloading
- Advanced audit logging

**WON'T HAVE (Out of Scope):**
- Complete system architecture redesign
- External service integrations
- Performance optimization

### Chain-of-Thought Requirements Reasoning
**Based on Pre-commit Failure Analysis** and **Governance Violation Documentation**, requirement REQ-1 (voice ID hardcoding) is **MUST-HAVE** because **no commits are possible until resolved**, enabling all subsequent development work.

**Based on Directory Structure Analysis** and **Professional Standards Research**, requirement REQ-2 (root directory cleanup) is **MUST-HAVE** because **deployment is blocked by governance hooks** until directory structure complies with 8-file limit.

## 2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Configuration Management Architecture
**Decision:** Adopt Pydantic Settings 2.0+ with hierarchical configuration
**Context:** Research validated this as August 2025 standard with enterprise adoption
**Options Considered:**
1. ✅ **Pydantic Settings 2.0+** (SELECTED)
   - Pros: Type safety, validation, enterprise standard
   - Cons: Additional dependency, learning curve
2. ❌ **ConfigParser/INI files**
   - Pros: Python standard library
   - Cons: No type safety, limited validation
3. ❌ **YAML-based configuration**
   - Pros: Human readable
   - Cons: Security risks, parsing complexity

**Rationale:** Pydantic Settings provides type safety, automatic validation, and enterprise-grade configuration management patterns validated through multi-source research.

### ADR-002: Directory Structure Architecture
**Decision:** Implement src layout with professional organization
**Context:** Python Packaging Authority official recommendation for professional projects
**Options Considered:**
1. ✅ **src layout** (SELECTED)
   - Pros: Prevents import accidents, professional standard
   - Cons: Requires import path updates
2. ❌ **Flat layout**
   - Pros: Simpler structure
   - Cons: Not recommended for professional projects
3. ❌ **Minimal reorganization**
   - Pros: Lower impact
   - Cons: Doesn't achieve full governance compliance

**Rationale:** src layout is the Python Packaging Authority standard for professional projects and aligns with enterprise development practices.

### ADR-003: Voice Configuration Governance
**Decision:** Centralized VoiceConfig with environment variable support
**Context:** Voice ID changes require explicit permission per governance requirements
**Options Considered:**
1. ✅ **Centralized VoiceConfig class** (SELECTED)
   - Pros: Single source of truth, validation, audit capability
   - Cons: Requires code changes across files
2. ❌ **Simple environment variables**
   - Pros: Minimal implementation
   - Cons: No validation or governance controls
3. ❌ **Configuration file only**
   - Pros: External configuration
   - Cons: Deployment complexity, no environment override

**Rationale:** Centralized approach provides governance controls, audit capability, and validation while supporting environment variable overrides.

2. **Response:** Fall back to current environment variable system
3. **Recovery:** Implement configuration system fixes with minimal downtime
4. **Prevention:** Comprehensive validation and testing before deployment

**Directory Structure Issues:**
1. **Detection:** Import failure monitoring and automated testing
2. **Response:** File mapping rollback to previous structure
3. **Recovery:** Fix broken imports and re-execute migration
