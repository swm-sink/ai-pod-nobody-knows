  <workflow>
    <research-rationale>
      This research is needed because:
      1. Our agents will use thinking modes for complex reasoning
      2. Different production stages need different thinking depths
      3. Cost optimization requires understanding thinking mode resource usage
      4. Quality outcomes depend on appropriate thinking mode selection
    </research-rationale>

    <expected-research-areas>
      - Technical specifications of each thinking mode
      - Resource consumption and cost implications
      - Best practices for mode selection
      - Integration with agent workflows
      - Performance optimization strategies
    </expected-research-areas>
  </workflow>

  <notes>
    **Technical:** Research workflow testing validates knowledge gathering and documentation generation patterns
    **Simple:** Like researching before making a big decision to make sure you have all the facts
    **Connection:** This teaches systematic research methodology and comprehensive documentation practices
