      <functionality>
        This command will:
        1. Check all 4 levels exist with proper directory structure
        2. Validate file placement according to level architecture
        3. Check naming conventions compliance
        4. Generate comprehensive validation report
        5. Provide specific fixing instructions for any issues
      </functionality>

      <quality-gates>
        - Directory structure: 100% compliance
        - File placement: 100% correct level assignment
        - Naming conventions: 100% consistency
        - Reference integrity: All links valid
      </quality-gates>
    </command-design>
  </workflow>

  <notes>
    **Technical:** Command creation testing validates orchestration patterns and quality gate integration
    **Simple:** Like testing a new recipe to make sure all the steps work together properly
    **Connection:** This teaches systematic testing of complex workflow automation tools
