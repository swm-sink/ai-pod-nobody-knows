   - Read the input file
   - Verify content is accessible

2. **Phase 2: Output** (30 seconds)
   - Create a test output file
   - Confirm successful creation

## Input Requirements
- test_input.txt (text file with sample content)

## Output Format
```
Test Result: [PASS/FAIL]
Timestamp: [ISO timestamp]
Details: [Any relevant information]
```

## Quality Criteria
- Must complete within 60 seconds
- Output file must be created successfully

## Error Handling
