# Testing Context-Researcher-Dev Command

**Purpose**: Validate that our context-researcher-dev command works correctly by researching and documenting a relevant topic.

Using context-researcher-dev to research: Claude Code thinking modes optimization

## Research Requirements Analysis

**Topic**: Claude Code thinking modes optimization
**Why needed**: To understand how to use think/think hard/think harder/ultrathink effectively
**Decisions it will inform**: When to use different thinking modes in our agents and commands
**Detail level required**: Practical implementation guidance with specific use cases

This research is needed because:
1. Our agents will use thinking modes for complex reasoning
2. Different production stages need different thinking depths
3. Cost optimization requires understanding thinking mode resource usage
4. Quality outcomes depend on appropriate thinking mode selection

Expected research areas:
- Technical specifications of each thinking mode
- Resource consumption and cost implications
- Best practices for mode selection
- Integration with agent workflows
- Performance optimization strategies
