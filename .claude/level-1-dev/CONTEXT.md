## 🎯 DOMAIN CONTEXT

**Technical:** Level 1 Development Platform focuses on meta-programming and tool creation - building tools that build the production system, including agent builders, command builders, and template systems with comprehensive testing and validation frameworks.

**Simple:** This is like having a workshop where you build the tools that will later build your actual products - it's the "tools to make tools" level.

**Connection:** Learning meta-development teaches you to think at a higher level of abstraction and is essential for building scalable, maintainable AI orchestration systems.

## 🤖 AGENTS SUBDIRECTORY CONTEXT

### **Meta-Agent Development**
- **agent-builder.md**: Creates new agents following established patterns
- **test-agent.md**: Comprehensive testing framework for agent validation  
- **file-validator.md**: Validates file structure and compliance

### **Agent Development Patterns**
```markdown
# Standard agent creation workflow:
1. Use agent-builder-dev.md command
2. Follow agent-template.yaml structure
3. Validate with test-agent.md
4. Quality check with file-validator.md
5. Deploy to appropriate level
```

### **Quality Standards**
- All agents must include comprehensive testing
- Follow established naming conventions
- Include educational dual explanations
- Validate against project standards

---

## ⚙️ COMMANDS SUBDIRECTORY CONTEXT

### **Development Workflow Automation**
- **agent-builder-dev.md**: Complete agent creation workflow
- **command-builder-dev.md**: Command creation and deployment
- **test-workflow.md**: Automated testing and validation

### **Command Development Philosophy**
```markdown
# Commands should be:
- Self-documenting with clear purposes
- Reusable across different contexts
- Educational with dual explanations
- Validated through comprehensive testing
```

### **Integration Patterns**
- Commands integrate with quality systems
- Follow atomic operation principles
- Include rollback and error handling
- Support both interactive and batch modes

---

## 📝 TEMPLATES SUBDIRECTORY CONTEXT

### **Template System Design**
- **Standardization**: Consistent patterns across all creation activities
- **Flexibility**: Configurable for different use cases
- **Quality**: Built-in validation and compliance checking
- **Education**: Templates include learning explanations

### **Available Templates**
- **agent-template.yaml**: Standard agent structure and patterns
- **command-template.yaml**: Command creation with best practices
- **workflow-template.yaml**: Development workflow standardization

## 🔄 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOWS

### **Agent Development Cycle**
```markdown
1. Plan → Use level-1-dev context for meta-programming approach
2. Design → Apply agent-template.yaml patterns
3. Implement → Follow quality standards and dual explanations
4. Test → Comprehensive validation with test-agent.md
5. Deploy → Move to appropriate production level
6. Monitor → Track performance and educational value
```

### **Command Development Cycle**
```markdown
1. Identify Need → Common workflow pattern or repetitive task
2. Design Interface → User-friendly command structure
3. Implement Logic → Robust error handling and validation
4. Test Thoroughly → Edge cases and integration testing
5. Document → Clear usage examples and educational value
6. Deploy → Make available to development workflows
```
