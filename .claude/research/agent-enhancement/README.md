# Agent Research Enhancement Infrastructure

## Purpose

**Technical:** Centralized repository for agent prompt research, model-specific optimization, and enhancement validation with full provenance tracking.

**Simple:** Think of this as a research lab for making our AI assistants smarter - we study how to improve them and keep detailed records.

**Connection:** This teaches systematic AI agent development with proper research methodology and version control.

## Research Standards

### Mandatory Research Process
1. **Perplexity Research**: 5+ comprehensive domain queries
2. **Model Optimization**: Research patterns for target models
3. **Source Validation**: 3+ authoritative sources per claim
4. **Cross-Model Testing**: Validate across available models
5. **Documentation**: Complete research provenance
6. **Version Tracking**: Track all changes with research citations

### Model-Specific Guidelines

#### Claude 4 Opus
- Explicit, concrete instructions with demonstrative examples
- Avoid redundancy and verbose context
- Use contextual framing with clear purpose
- Provide specific output constraints

#### Claude Sonnet 4
- Contextual framing with purpose clarification
- Structured output templates
- Clear role definitions
- Explicit safety and boundary instructions

#### Gemini Pro 2.5
- Chain-of-thought prompting patterns
- Role priming for task-specific behavior
- Structured output schemas
- Function and capability definitions

### Integration Patterns

#### Perplexity Optimization
- Direct, specific query structures
- Multi-round search strategies
- Expert perspective extraction
- Source credibility assessment

#### ElevenLabs Optimization
- Conversational phrasing patterns
- Strategic SSML usage
- Natural speech optimization
- Voice setting recommendations

## Usage Guidelines

### For Agent Enhancement
1. Create agent-specific folder in relevant capability area
2. Conduct required Perplexity research (5+ queries)
3. Document findings with source citations
4. Develop model-specific optimizations
5. Test across available models
6. Document performance improvements
7. Update agent with research-backed enhancements

### For Research Documentation
- Use provided templates for consistency
- Include all source citations and links
- Document both successful and failed experiments
- Track quantitative performance metrics
- Maintain version history with rationale

### For Validation Studies
- Test enhanced agents against baselines
- Document performance across different models
- Track user experience improvements
- Validate backward compatibility
- Record both quantitative and qualitative results

## Quality Standards

- **Research Depth**: Minimum 5 Perplexity queries per enhancement
- **Source Quality**: Authoritative, recent sources preferred
- **Documentation**: Complete provenance with citations
- **Testing**: Cross-model validation required
- **Performance**: Quantitative improvement metrics
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility preservation

## Maintenance

- Regular research updates (quarterly recommended)
- Model compatibility reviews with new releases
- Performance benchmark updates
- Documentation currency verification
- Archive outdated research with historical context
