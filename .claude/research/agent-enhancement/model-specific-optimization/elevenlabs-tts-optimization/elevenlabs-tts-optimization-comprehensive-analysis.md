### Cost Optimization Implementation Within Episode Budget

#### Budget Distribution and Control Framework
```
TTS BUDGET ALLOCATION (within $33.25 episode):
- Voice Synthesis: $4.50-6.75 (67-75% of TTS allocation)
- Voice Management: $1.00-1.50 (15-20% of TTS allocation)
- Quality Assurance: $0.50-1.00 (8-12% of TTS allocation)
- Buffer/Optimization: $0.30-0.70 (5-8% of TTS allocation)

COST EFFICIENCY TARGETS:
- Character Optimization: 25% reduction through script efficiency
- Model Selection: 45% cost savings through strategic Turbo deployment
- Batch Processing: 35% efficiency improvement through workflow optimization
- Volume Benefits: 50% cost reduction through enterprise pricing
```
