## Phase 1: Sonar Deep Research Results

### Query 1: Multi-Model Quality Assessment Frameworks

**Research Findings - Multi-Model Quality Assessment:**

**Dual Evaluator Architecture Patterns:**
- **Primary-Secondary Model**: Claude 4.1 Opus as primary (detailed analysis) + Gemini Pro 2.5 as secondary (validation)
- **Parallel Independent Evaluation**: Both models evaluate simultaneously with consensus resolution
- **Cascaded Validation**: Initial screening by cost-effective model, detailed analysis by premium model
- **Weighted Ensemble Scoring**: Combined scores with model-specific confidence weightings

**Industry Best Practices:**
- **Model Selection Strategy**: Different architectures provide complementary strengths (Claude: nuanced analysis, Gemini: speed/consistency)
- **Bias Mitigation**: Independent evaluation reduces single-model bias and hallucination risks
- **Confidence Calibration**: Each model provides confidence scores for weighted consensus
- **Error Detection**: Cross-validation catches systematic errors from individual models

**Production Implementation Framework:**
```yaml
dual_evaluation_architecture:
  primary_evaluator:
    model: "claude-4.1-opus"
    role: "comprehensive_analysis"
    cost_per_evaluation: "$0.50"
    strengths: ["nuanced_analysis", "brand_voice_assessment", "contextual_understanding"]

  secondary_evaluator:
    model: "gemini-pro-2.5"
    role: "independent_validation"
