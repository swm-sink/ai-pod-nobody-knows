## 1. Multi-Agent Coordination Frameworks

### Supervisor Pattern (Recommended for Research Orchestration)
```yaml
orchestration_pattern:
  supervisor_role: "Research Coordinator"
  subagents:
    - deep_research_agent: "Collect and cite recent technical sources"
    - question_generator: "Identify gaps and generate research questions"
    - synthesis_agent: "Aggregate findings and resolve conflicts"

  coordination_method: "Hierarchical delegation with explicit boundaries"
  communication: "Structured JSON handoffs with validation"
  quality_control: "Validation checkpoints at each handoff"
```

### Hierarchical Orchestration Pattern
```markdown
# Research Orchestration Template

ROLE: You are a Research Orchestrator managing 3 specialized agents.

AGENTS UNDER MANAGEMENT:
- Deep Research Agent: Finds authoritative, recent publications
- Question Generator: Identifies research gaps and formulates questions
- Synthesis Agent: Integrates findings and resolves discrepancies

COORDINATION PROTOCOL:
1. Decompose research query into distinct subtasks
2. Assign each subtask to appropriate specialist agent
3. Validate agent outputs for completeness and quality
4. Consolidate outputs and resolve conflicts
5. Provide final synthesized research package

OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON with agent assignments, progress tracking, and validation results
```

### Delegation Patterns with Error Handling
```yaml
delegation_strategy:
  task_assignment:
    - explicit_objectives: Clear, measurable deliverables
    - boundary_definition: Scope limitations and forbidden actions
    - handoff_protocols: Standardized transition mechanisms
    - escalation_paths: When and how to escalate issues

  error_handling:
    - validation_checkpoints: Quality gates at each transition
    - retry_logic: Automatic retry with adjusted parameters
    - fallback_strategies: Alternative approaches when primary fails
    - graceful_degradation: Minimum viable outputs when full completion impossible
```

---

## 2. Research Workflow Orchestration

### Task Decomposition Framework
```yaml
decomposition_approach:
  hierarchical_analysis:
    primary_task: "Deep-dive podcast episode research on [TOPIC]"
    subtasks:
      - topic_exploration: "Map landscape and key themes"
      - source_collection: "Gather authoritative recent sources"
      - fact_verification: "Cross-verify claims and statistics"
      - synthesis: "Integrate findings into coherent narrative"
      - gap_identification: "Identify knowledge gaps and questions"

  agent_assignment:
    deep_research: [source_collection, fact_verification]
    question_generator: [gap_identification, topic_exploration]
    synthesis: [synthesis, final_integration]
```

### Dynamic Task Allocation
```markdown
# Dynamic Assignment Protocol

ASSIGNMENT_CRITERIA:
- Agent specialty match to task requirements
- Current agent workload and availability
- Task complexity and estimated processing time
- Quality requirements and validation needs

LOAD_BALANCING:
- Monitor agent queue depth and response times
- Redistribute tasks if bottlenecks detected
- Scale agent allocation based on research complexity
- Prioritize high-quality over speed for critical tasks

CAPABILITY_MATCHING:
- Deep Research: Best for source gathering, fact verification
- Question Generator: Optimal for gap analysis, inquiry formulation
- Synthesis: Ideal for integration, conflict resolution
```

### Dependency Management
```yaml
workflow_dependencies:
  sequential_dependencies:
    - source_collection → fact_verification
    - gap_identification → question_formulation
    - all_research → final_synthesis

  parallel_opportunities:
    - deep_research + question_generation (concurrent)
    - fact_verification + gap_analysis (concurrent)
    - preliminary_synthesis + additional_research (concurrent)

  handoff_protocols:
    completion_signals: "Agent signals task completion with status update"
    data_transfer: "Structured JSON with results and metadata"
    validation_gates: "Quality check before downstream processing"
```

    - periodic_state_snapshots: Create executive summaries at major milestones

  token_efficiency:
    - structured_formats: Use JSON to minimize unnecessary tokens
    - reference_patterns: Point to stored research rather than repeating content
    - compact_instructions: Concise, focused task definitions
    - batch_processing: Group similar coordination tasks
```

    }
  }
}
```

### Cost-Efficient Orchestration Patterns
```yaml
cost_optimization:
  token_efficiency:
    - batch_similar_tasks: Process multiple agent requests together
    - compress_context: Use executive summaries instead of full history
    - selective_inclusion: Include only essential prior results

    - quality_thresholds: Define minimum viable outputs to avoid over-processing
    - caching_strategies: Reuse research results across similar topics
```

```

### Cross-Validation Patterns
```markdown
# Peer Review Protocol for Research Agents

2. Secondary agent independently validates key findings
3. Cross-reference agent checks citation accuracy
4. Synthesis agent resolves any conflicts or discrepancies
5. Orchestrator performs final quality assessment

CONSENSUS_BUILDING:
- Multi-agent verification for critical claims
- Conflict resolution through evidence weighing
- Expert escalation for unresolvable disputes
- Documentation of disagreements and rationale

QUALITY_METRICS:
- Inter-agent agreement rates
- Citation verification success rates
- Source authority distribution
- Coverage completeness scores
```

### Knowledge Synthesis Protocols

```

### Self-Correction Patterns
```markdown
# Self-Correction Protocol

REFLECTION_PHASE:

2. Identifies potential issues or improvements
3. Attempts self-correction if problems detected
4. Documents correction attempts and rationale

VALIDATION_PHASE:
1. Orchestrator validates agent output against schema
2. Checks compliance with quality gates
3. Identifies any remaining issues
4. Triggers retry or escalation if needed

2. Update agent prompts based on common issues
3. Refine quality criteria based on validation results
4. Improve orchestration logic for future tasks
