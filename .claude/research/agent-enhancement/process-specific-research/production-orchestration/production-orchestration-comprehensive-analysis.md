## 1. Multi-Agent Production Pipeline Coordination Patterns

### Sequential vs Parallel Processing Strategies

```yaml
coordination_frameworks:
  sequential_orchestration:
    - pipes_and_filters: Each agent processes content in strict order
    - transformation_chain: Output from one becomes input to next
    - narrative_preservation: Essential for script → review → polish → audio workflow
    - dependency_management: Strict ordering for quality-dependent stages

  parallel_orchestration:
    - simultaneous_execution: Multiple agents work on same/partitioned inputs
    - merge_validation: Results consolidated at integration checkpoints
    - throughput_optimization: Show notes, artwork, promotion planning in parallel
    - resource_maximization: Utilize full agent capacity during independent tasks

  hybrid_orchestration:
    - dynamic_scheduling: Central orchestrator manages dependencies
    - adaptive_routing: Sequential for dependent stages, parallel for independent
    - milestone_coordination: Synchronization points for quality gates
    - efficiency_optimization: Balance speed with narrative coherence
```

### Group Chat Orchestration Patterns (LLM-Centric)

```markdown
# Advanced Coordination Patterns for 10+ Agents

## Round Robin Pattern
- Agents speak in predetermined order ensuring equal participation
- Ideal for brainstorming phases and multi-perspective content editing
- Maintains structured workflow with predictable handoffs

## LLM-Driven Selection (AutoPattern)
- Claude Sonnet 4 dynamically chooses next agent based on context
- Supports adaptive routing and agent specialization
- Ideal for unpredictable or goal-directed content flows

## Explicit Handoff Protocol
- Control shifts only when defined agent completes task
- Best for compliance-critical stages requiring expert review
- Ensures quality gates and validation checkpoints

## Goal/Task-Oriented Orchestration
- LLM autonomously determines agent/tool usage and sequence
- Minimizes manual workflow definition
- Supports dynamic agent composition as needs evolve
```

    - independent_llm: Different model architecture to reduce bias
    - bias_mitigation: Secondary reviewer with different prompt profiles
