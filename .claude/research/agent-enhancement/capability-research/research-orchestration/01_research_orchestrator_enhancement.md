## Model-Specific Optimization Research

### Claude 4 Opus Optimization
- **Pattern Research**: Explicit, detailed, unambiguous instructions yield highest accuracy. Clear content, style, tone, and output structure specifications are essential.
- **Token Efficiency**: Higher cost model requires trimmed unnecessary context, direct formulations, specified output limits, and concrete examples for complex tasks.
- **Specific Recommendations**: Use contextual framing explaining purpose/audience, provide inline demonstrations for complex outputs, avoid verbose formulations.
- **Examples**: "Orchestrate research for episode on [TOPIC]. Create session directory, coordinate 3 agents sequentially, save complete research data as JSON with expert quotes, sources, and synthesis. Budget: $1.50 max."

### Claude Sonnet 4 Optimization
- **Pattern Research**: Purpose clarification with end-use context, highly structured prompts with explicit schemas, and safety/compliance instructions up-front.
- **Contextual Framing**: State end-use clearly ("This output will coordinate research agents for podcast production"), use structured sections and markdown formatting.
- **Specific Recommendations**: Request explicit schemas, bullet lists, markdown tables. Use steerability nudges ("Be exhaustive," "Be precise"). Include safety constraints early.
- **Examples**: "You are a research orchestrator for podcast production. Create structured coordination plan: (A) Agent sequence, (B) Data requirements, (C) Quality checkpoints, (D) Error handling. Output as markdown sections."

### Gemini Pro 2.5 Optimization
- **Pattern Research**: Chain-of-thought reasoning ("think step by step"), explicit persona assignment, function definitions for tool use, conversational framing for multi-turn contexts.
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Prompt step-by-step reasoning, show logic before conclusions, use role priming ("You are a research coordinator"), define argument types and constraints.
- **Specific Recommendations**: Use pseudo-code schemas, JSON structure definitions, explicit memory references in multi-turn workflows, conversational context preservation.
- **Examples**: "You are a research orchestrator. Think step by step: 1) Analyze episode requirements, 2) Plan agent sequence, 3) Define success criteria, 4) Execute coordination. Show reasoning for each decision. Remember: Focus on intellectual humility brand alignment."

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Quality Framework

**Quality Assessment Matrix** (NIST AI RMF Inspired):
```yaml
quality_dimensions:
  accuracy: {weight: 0.25, threshold: 0.85}
  completeness: {weight: 0.20, threshold: 0.80}
  credibility: {weight: 0.20, threshold: 0.85}

```

**Self-Reviewing Agent Integration**:
After each phase, automatically trigger quality review:
```

```

### 4. Cross-Episode Intelligence System

**Knowledge Management Integration**:
- **Semantic Clustering**: Automatically identify thematic relationships
- **Knowledge Graph Updates**: Link concepts, sources, and insights across episodes
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Surface relevant previous research for current topic

const reusable_research = await identify_reusable_components(knowledge_context);
```

### 5. Resilient Error Handling

**Predictive Fault Detection**:
- Monitor resource usage patterns and predict bottlenecks
- Track agent response times and quality degradation
- Alert on anomalous research patterns or quality drops

**Automated Recovery Mechanisms**:

    - retry_count: 3
    - backoff_strategy: exponential
    - fallback_agent: human_review_trigger
  quality_failure:
    - auto_retry_with_refined_prompt: true
