```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
```python
# Research Chain Pattern
def multi_query_research(topic, depth=3):
    results = []
    context = f"Research topic: {topic}"

    for query_round in range(depth):
        prompt = build_research_prompt(context, query_round)
        result = sonar_api.research(prompt)
        results.append(result)
        context = update_context(context, result)

    return synthesize_results(results)
```

### Quality Assurance
1. **Source Verification**: Always check citation quality and authority
2. **Bias Detection**: Look for multiple perspectives and conflicting views

        return cached_result

    result = sonar_api.research(query)
    cache.set(cache_key, result, cache_duration)
    return result
```
