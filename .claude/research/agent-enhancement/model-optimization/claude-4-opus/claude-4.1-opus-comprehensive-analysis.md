        try:
            response = claude_api.complete(prompt)
            validate_output(response)
            return response
        except RateLimitError:
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt
            time.sleep(wait_time)
        except ContextLengthError:
            prompt = truncate_context(prompt)
        except ValidationError:
