## Best Practices for Implementation

### CLI Prompt Engineering Patterns
```markdown
# Optimal CLI Evaluation Structure

EVALUATION_REQUEST: Analyze podcast episode for quality metrics

AUDIO_INPUT: [audio file path]

EVALUATION_CRITERIA:
- Clarity (1-5 scale)
- Engagement (1-5 scale)
- Brand alignment (1-5 scale)
- Technical quality (1-5 scale)
- Bias detection (flag issues)

OUTPUT_FORMAT: JSON with scores, timestamps, and specific feedback

COMPARISON: [optional reference episode for comparative evaluation]
```

### Optimization Techniques
1. **Specify Output Schema**: Always request JSON/XML for programmatic processing
2. **Language Specification**: Explicitly state language and dialect expectations
3. **Quality Metrics**: Define specific 1-5 scales for consistent scoring
4. **Timestamp Requirements**: Request timestamps for actionable feedback
5. **Batch Configuration**: Optimize batch sizes for throughput vs latency

### Integration Strategies
1. **Parallel Evaluation**: Run alongside Claude-based evaluation for consensus
2. **Scheduled Processing**: Use cron jobs for automated daily/weekly evaluation
3. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for API limits and audio format issues
4. **Output Storage**: Standardize JSON/CSV storage for metrics tracking
5. **Quality Thresholds**: Set automated pass/fail thresholds for production gates

def gemini_cli_evaluate(audio_path, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            result = gemini_cli.evaluate(audio_path)
            validate_evaluation_output(result)
            return result
        except QuotaExceededError:
            wait_time = min(2 ** attempt * 60, 3600)  # Exponential backoff
            time.sleep(wait_time)
        except AudioFormatError:
            audio_path = convert_audio_format(audio_path)
        except ContentFlaggedError:
            return create_flagged_response(audio_path)
    raise EvaluationFailed()
