*Research Date: August 22, 2025*
*Episode 5: AI Regulation Research Package*

## Executive Summary
2025 marks a pivotal year for AI regulation globally, with the EU AI Act taking effect, China expanding generative AI controls, and the US shifting toward deregulation. Tech companies face unprecedented compliance complexity while developing innovative approaches to algorithmic transparency, AI safety, and responsible deployment. The regulatory landscape remains fragmented but increasingly sophisticated.

## Key Research Findings

- Enhanced documentation for state compliance (California focus)

### Key Debates & Emerging Trends

#### AI Safety vs. Competitiveness
- **US Deregulation**: Contrasts with EU/China risk-mitigation approaches
- **National Security**: Regulation impact on economic leadership and security
- **Innovation Balance**: Tension between safety requirements and technological advancement

#### Algorithmic Transparency & Data Protection
