## 9. **Stoicism vs. Other Philosophical Approaches**

| Topic                   | Stoicism                             | Mindfulness                        | Positive Psychology      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Core Principle          | Virtue, rational control of self     | Present awareness, non-judgment    | Building strengths, flourishing  |
| View on Emotions        | Reframe/react to emotions rationally | Notice emotions without judging    | Cultivate positive emotions |
| Attitude to Life Events | Accept what you cannot control       | Accept but do not analyze          | Reframe for optimism    |

- **Comparison:** Stoicism shares mindfulness's attention to the present but emphasizes ethical action and control, whereas positive psychology focuses more on happiness and flourishing[2].
- **Scientific Overlap:** Both CBT and mindfulness meditation integrate Stoic techniques, but with different accents—Stoics stress reason and virtue, mindfulness emphasizes acceptance, positive psychology celebrates positive affect.
