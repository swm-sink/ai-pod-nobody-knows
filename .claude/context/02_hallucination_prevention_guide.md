# Hallucination Prevention Guide

**Phase:** walk
**Skill Level:** intermediate
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes


## Anti hallucination policy

## Prevention strategies

**Example:**

**Example:**
RAG Implementation for API Documentation

```bash
Like doing homework by reading the textbook first instead of guessing - much more accurate results


**Example:**
Uncertainty Acknowledgment for Performance Claims

```bash
Like a good teacher saying "Let me look that up" instead of guessing wrong information


**Example:**
Direct Quote Grounding for Technical Specifications

```bash
Like being a detective who only draws conclusions from actual evidence you can point to


## Validation workflow

### Setup Instructions


- 
        Identify all statements that assert facts (statistics, events, specifications)

- 
        = 3 {print &quot;Minimum research completed&quot;}'">Conduct 3-10 searches with adaptive rules for conflicting information

- 
        Compare information across sources using decision tree logic

- 
        Ensure every factual claim includes source URL and access date

- 
        Disclose confidence levels using standard ranges (90-100%, 70-89%, 50-69%, &lt;50%)

```bash

```bash
All factual claims have source citations
Confidence levels disclosed for uncertain information
Minimum 3 sources for technical specifications
Uncertainty acknowledged when confidence &lt; 80%

## Research categories

**Example:**

**Example:**
Technical Specifications Validation

```bash
Technology changes fast, so you need current sources from the people who built it


**Example:**
Statistics and Data Validation

```bash
Numbers can be misleading, so you need to see how they were calculated originally


## Hallucination red flags

**Example:**

**Example:**
Red Flag: Specific Numbers Without Source

```bash
Specific numbers sound authoritative but are often the most likely to be hallucinated


**Example:**
Red Flag: Absolute Statements

```bash
Real world rarely has absolutes - adding nuance makes claims more accurate


## Claude code automation

**Example:**

**Example:**
Automated Thinking Mode Escalation

```bash
Like automatically calling in experts when dealing with difficult or dangerous situations


**Example:**
Parallel Fact-Checking Subagents

```bash
Like having a team of specialists each check different parts of the information at the same time


## Uncertainty language

**Example:**

**Example:**
High Uncertainty Expression

```bash
Better to admit you don't know than to guess and be wrong


**Example:**
Qualified Statement with Source

```bash
Shows exactly where the information comes from and when it was accurate
