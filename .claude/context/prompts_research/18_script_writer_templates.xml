        Think of this like writing a play where two friends discuss fascinating topics—one asks
        great questions while the other shares knowledge, but both admit when they hit the limits
        of what anyone really knows.

      <excerpt>
        <![CDATA[
[COLD OPEN]

Alex: Jordan, I'm looking at you right now, and I know you're conscious.

Jordan: How do you know that?

Alex: I... huh. I actually don't know how I know.

Jordan: And that's the heart of the hardest problem in all of science.

[INTRO MUSIC]

Alex: Welcome back to Nobody Knows, where we explore the edges of human knowledge.

Jordan: Today, we're tackling consciousness—the one thing you know exists...

Alex: But can't prove to anyone else!

Jordan: Exactly. It's the ultimate "nobody knows" topic.

[MAIN CONTENT]

Alex: So let's start basic. What is consciousness?

Jordan: [laughs] If I could answer that, I'd have a Nobel Prize.

Alex: Seriously?

Jordan: David Chalmers calls it "the hard problem" for a reason.

Alex: Okay, but we must know something?

Jordan: We know it involves awareness, experience, that feeling of "what it's like."

Alex: Like what it's like to see red?

Jordan: Perfect example! That "redness" you experience? That's qualia.

Alex: Qualia?

Jordan: The subjective, felt quality of experiences.

Alex: Which science can't measure.

Jordan: Bingo. We can measure brain activity when you see red...

Alex: But not the actual experience of redness.

Jordan: And that gap? That's where science hits a wall.

[CLOSING]

Alex: So after all this, we don't know what consciousness is?

Jordan: We don't know how it arises, why it exists, or even how to measure it.

Alex: The thing we know most intimately...

Jordan: Is the thing science understands least.

Alex: That's beautifully frustrating.

Jordan: Welcome to the mystery of being human.
