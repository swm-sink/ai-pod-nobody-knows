                AI orchestration mastery involves coordinating multiple AI agents to work together efficiently, managing computational resources, ensuring quality outputs, and building scalable systems. This guide provides a comprehensive learning path from basic concepts to expert-level implementation, focusing on practical skills through the podcast production use case.

            <simple-explanation>
                Think of becoming an AI orchestration master like learning to conduct an orchestra. You start by understanding individual instruments (agents), then learn how they work together (orchestration), and finally master the art of creating beautiful symphonies (production systems) while managing your budget (token economics).
