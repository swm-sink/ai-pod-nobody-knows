# Learning Milestones & Achievements - Dual-Track Progression üèÜ

**Technical Explanation**: This dual-track achievement system recognizes progress in both AI orchestration mastery (80% focus) and Claude Code development acceleration (20% focus), providing structured milestones that build professional-grade skills in both domains simultaneously.

**Simple Breakdown**: Think of this like earning badges in two related skills - you're becoming an expert chef (AI orchestration) while also mastering professional kitchen management (Claude Code). Both skills complement each other and make you more capable overall.
