</dual-learning-philosophy>

### Week 1: Environment Setup (AI + Development) ✅

#### Core Environment (Required)
```bash
# These all work without API keys:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests/  # Run any tests
```

#### Claude Code Setup (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Install Claude Code (free)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Navigate to your project
cd ai-podcasts-nobody-knows

# Initialize Claude Code memory system
claude /init

# This creates CLAUDE.md - your project memory!
```

**Dual Learning Goals:**
- **AI Foundation**: Understand virtual environments, explore AI agent codebase structure
- **Development Skills**: Learn pip package management, understand project organization
- **Claude Code Basics**: Set up intelligent project memory and context management
- **Integration**: Use Claude Code to document your AI learning journey

### Week 2: Local Server Mastery + Development Workflow 🖥️

#### Start the Server (No APIs Needed!)
```bash
# This works completely offline:
# Reference from Operations Constants
# Use: SERVER_COMMANDS['start_dev']
uvicorn core.orchestration.server:app --reload

# Visit in browser:
# http://localhost:8000
# http://localhost:8000/docs  # Interactive API documentation!
```

#### Test Every Endpoint (Manual + Automated)
```bash
# Manual testing (understand concepts)
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_name": "test-podcast", "episode_duration": 27}'
curl http://localhost:8000/projects
```

#### Claude Code Acceleration (Optional)
```bash
# Create reusable test commands
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Create /test-server command
echo "Test the local server endpoints and validate responses" > .claude/commands/test-server.md

# Create /document-api command  
echo "Document the API endpoints I've discovered in CLAUDE.md" > .claude/commands/document-api.md

# Use your commands
claude /test-server
claude /document-api
```

**Dual Learning Outcomes:**
- **AI Concepts**: How agent orchestration APIs work, request/response patterns
- **Technical Skills**: REST APIs, FastAPI documentation, JSON data structures  
- **Claude Code Skills**: Custom commands, automated documentation, workflow organization
- **Integration**: Use Claude Code to systematically test and document your AI system understanding

### Week 3: Manual Content Creation + Documentation Workflow 📝

#### Create Episode Scripts Manually (Core AI Learning)
1. Use the episode structure template
2. Write 3 complete episode scripts  
3. Practice the "Nobody Knows" voice
4. Time yourself reading them (aim for 27 minutes)

#### Script Template Exercise
```markdown
# Episode 1: [Your Topic]

## Introduction (1.5 min)
[Write your hook]
[Write your preview]

## Segment 1: Foundation (8 min)
[Write your foundation content]

## Segment 2: Exploration (8 min)
[Write your exploration content]

## Segment 3: Synthesis (8 min)
[Write your synthesis]

## Conclusion (1.5 min)
[Write your closing]
```

#### Claude Code Content Workflow (Optional Enhancement)
```bash
# Create content management commands
echo "Help me brainstorm episode topics that fit the Nobody Knows theme" > .claude/commands/brainstorm-topics.md
echo "Review my episode script for brand voice consistency and timing" > .claude/commands/review-script.md
echo "Create an episode quality checklist I can reuse" > .claude/commands/create-checklist.md

# Create content templates
mkdir -p .claude/templates
cp your-episode-template.md .claude/templates/episode-template.md

# Use Claude Code for content workflow
claude /brainstorm-topics
claude /review-script "episodes/episode-001-consciousness.md"
claude /create-checklist
```

#### Advanced Content Organization
```bash
# Organize your content systematically
mkdir -p episodes/{drafts,completed,ideas}

# Use Claude Code to track content progress
echo "Show me the status of all my episodes and next steps" > .claude/commands/content-status.md
claude /content-status
```

**Learning Integration:**
- **AI Content Skills**: Master the "Nobody Knows" voice, understand episode structure for AI generation
- **Content Creation**: Practice manual content creation to understand what you'll later automate
- **Claude Code Workflows**: Learn systematic content management and quality review processes
- **Future Preparation**: Build templates and workflows you'll use when AI agents start generating content
