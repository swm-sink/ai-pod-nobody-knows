<philosophical-reminder>
  <core-message>
    This is YOUR dual-learning journey in AI orchestration and modern development practices. 
    Every "failure" teaches you about both AI system design AND development workflows. 
    Every successful episode proves you're mastering complex AI coordination.
    
    Remember: You're not just building a podcast system - you're becoming an AI systems engineer 
    who can design, build, and deploy sophisticated AI solutions. Take it step by step, 
    understand each piece deeply, and build expertise that will serve you for years.
