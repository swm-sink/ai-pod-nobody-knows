                Progressive skill development system where you master AI orchestration fundamentals while optionally accelerating development with Claude Code tools. The framework emphasizes AI orchestration as primary learning track (80% focus) with Claude Code as development enhancement track (20% focus). Each phase builds both AI system design skills and modern development capabilities with clear integration points.

            <simple-explanation>
                Think of it like learning to cook - first you learn basic techniques by hand (AI orchestration), then you add kitchen tools like food processors (Claude Code) to cook faster and better, but you still need to understand cooking fundamentals. Each phase teaches you more advanced techniques while giving you better tools.

        <section type="implementation" id="walk-phase">
            <technical-explanation>
                WALK Phase (Weeks 1-4, FREE): Master AI orchestration fundamentals without API costs. Focus on understanding agent concepts, designing manual workflows, and building foundational multi-agent systems knowledge. Optional Claude Code integration for basic setup and project organization after understanding manual processes.
            </technical-explanation>
            <simple-explanation>
                The walking phase is like learning to walk before you run - you understand how AI agents work and coordinate without spending any money. You can optionally add some basic tools to help organize your learning, but the focus is on understanding the concepts deeply.

            <technical-explanation>
                Phase transitions require meeting specific readiness criteria before progression. Each transition includes skill validation, system capability verification, and optional Claude Code integration assessment. Transitions ensure solid foundation before adding complexity and investment.

            <simple-explanation>
                You don't move to the next phase until you've mastered the current one - like not learning to run until you can walk steadily. Each transition has clear checkpoints to make sure you're ready for the next level of challenge.
