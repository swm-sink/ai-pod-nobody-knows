## üîß DIRECT API INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK

### MCP Integration Failure Analysis
```yaml
mcp_failure_assessment:
  persistent_issues:
    - error_pattern: "invalid_api_key despite valid API key in environment"
    - server_problems: "ElevenLabs MCP couldn't access environment variables"
    - environment_loading: "Variables must be loaded before Claude Code starts"
    - result: "Complete blocking of audio synthesis workflow"

  troubleshooting_attempts:
    - api_key_validation: "Confirmed valid API key exists and is properly formatted" # pragma: allowlist secret
    - environment_setup: "Verified environment variable loading with source .env"
    - configuration_check: "Validated MCP configuration in .mcp.json"

## ‚è±Ô∏è DURATION CALCULATION OPTIMIZATION

### Critical WPM Discovery
```yaml

    expected_total: "26.89 minutes"

  empirical_findings:
    actual_wpm: 206-210
    calculation: "1,506 words √∑ 206 WPM = 7.31 minutes base"
    actual_duration: "11 minutes (with partial SSML processing)"

      narrative_content: "200-210 WPM (standard rate)"
      conversational: "220-230 WPM (10% faster)"

  ssml_processing_rates:
    short_breaks_500ms: "Processing rate: 40% (often ignored)"
    medium_breaks_1s: "Processing rate: 80% (reliably processed)"
    long_breaks_2s: "Processing rate: 95% (processed at full duration)"
    extended_breaks_3s: "Processing rate: 100% (processed at full duration)"

  calculation_formula: |
    base_duration = word_count / adjusted_wpm
    ssml_duration = sum(break_duration * processing_rate)
    total_duration = base_duration + ssml_duration
```

### Production Duration Calculator
```python
def calculate_episode_duration(word_count: int, break_tags: Dict[str, int],
                             content_type: str = "narrative") -> float:

        "technical": 185,
        "narrative": 206,
        "conversational": 225
    }

    # SSML break processing rates
    break_processing = {
        "500ms": {"duration": 0.5, "rate": 0.4},
        "1s": {"duration": 1.0, "rate": 0.8},

    # Calculate SSML break duration
    ssml_duration = 0

## üìù SSML OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Empirical SSML Effectiveness
```yaml
ssml_tag_analysis:
  break_tag_distribution:
    episode_1_analysis:
      break_500ms: "28 instances - Often ignored (40% processing rate)"
      break_1s: "20 instances - Reliably processed (80% processing rate)"
      break_2s: "12 instances - Processed at full duration (95% processing rate)"
      break_3s: "4 instances - Processed at full duration (100% processing rate)"

  processing_reliability_matrix:
    short_breaks: "500ms breaks unreliable, consider 1s minimum"
    medium_breaks: "1s breaks provide good balance of control and reliability"
    long_breaks: "2s+ breaks processed consistently but may affect pacing"
    recommendation: "Use 1s as standard break, 2s for emphasis, avoid 500ms"
```

### Optimized SSML Patterns
```xml
<!-- Recommended SSML patterns for consistent processing -->

<!-- Standard paragraph break -->
<break time="1s"/>

<!-- Section transition -->
<break time="2s"/>

<!-- Major topic transition -->
<break time="3s"/>

<!-- Emphasis patterns -->
<emphasis level="moderate">important concept</emphasis>
<emphasis level="strong">critical point</emphasis>

<!-- Speed adjustments -->
<prosody rate="0.9">technical explanation</prosody>
<prosody rate="1.1">casual conversation</prosody>

<!-- Voice characteristics -->
<voice name="Amelia" style="professional">
    Content with consistent voice settings
</voice>
```

### SSML Quality Guidelines
```yaml
ssml_best_practices:
  break_optimization:
    minimum_break: "1s (avoid 500ms due to low processing rate)"
    standard_break: "1s for paragraph transitions"
    section_break: "2s for section transitions"
    chapter_break: "3s for major topic changes"

  emphasis_usage:
    moderate_emphasis: "For important concepts and definitions"
    strong_emphasis: "For critical points requiring attention"
    avoid_overuse: "Maximum 5-10 emphasis tags per 1000 words"

  prosody_control:
    rate_adjustments: "0.9-1.1 range for natural variation"
    pitch_modifications: "Minimal use, let natural voice handle inflection"
    volume_control: "Avoid volume tags, use emphasis instead"
