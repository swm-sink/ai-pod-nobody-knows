# Agent Architecture & MCP Integration - Native Claude Code Simplified
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Updated:** 2025-09-01
**Purpose:** Complete agent orchestration and MCP integration patterns

## üö® Critical Architectural Principles

### Correct Sub-Agent Invocation
**NEVER use Task tool for sub-agents** - Sub-agents are invoked directly by name, not through Task tool proxy delegation.

**Correct Pattern:**
```markdown
Use the researcher agent to investigate: "topic details with specific requirements"
```

**Incorrect Pattern (DO NOT USE):**
```markdown
Task tool: Launch researcher agent... ‚ùå
```

### MCP Tool Inheritance
**Key Insight:** Sub-agents automatically inherit ALL MCP tools when the `tools` field is omitted in their YAML configuration.

```yaml
# Correct - Inherits all MCP tools
name: researcher
model: claude-3-5-sonnet
# tools field omitted = full inheritance

# Incorrect - Limited to specified tools only
name: researcher
model: claude-3-5-sonnet
tools: [Read, Write]  # ‚ùå Blocks MCP inheritance
```

  accuracy: "‚â•95% fact verification"
  cost: "$0.50-1.00 per episode"
  time: "5-10 minutes"

production_agents:
  quality: "‚â•0.90 brand consistency"
  engagement: "‚â•0.80 score"
  cost: "$0.75-1.50 per episode"
  time: "5-10 minutes"

```

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Batch Processing** - 30% cost reduction at scale
2. **Cache Research** - Avoid duplicate API calls
3. **Model Selection** - Use appropriate model for task
4. **Token Optimization** - Concise prompts, selective context
5. **Single-Call Audio** - Leverage 40K character limit

## üîÑ Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Issues & Solutions
```yaml
mcp_authentication:
  error: "401 invalid_api_key"
  solution: "Ensure env vars loaded before Claude Code starts"
  command: "./build/scripts/start-claude.sh"

synthesis_timeout:
  error: "ElevenLabs timeout"
  solution: "Chunk script if >40K characters"
  fallback: "Use chunked synthesis mode"

quality_failure:
  error: "Score below threshold"
  solution: "Review judge feedback, iterate"
  retry: "Maximum 3 attempts"

cost_overrun:
  error: "Budget exceeded"
  solution: "Check pre-validation hooks"
  prevention: "Monitor continuously"
```

## üé™ Best Practices

### Agent Design
1. **Single Responsibility** - Each agent has one clear purpose
2. **Tool Inheritance** - Omit tools field for MCP access
3. **Clear Interfaces** - Well-defined inputs/outputs
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation
5. **Cost Awareness** - Monitor and optimize

### Orchestration
1. **Direct Invocation** - Use agent name directly
2. **Clear Requirements** - Specific, measurable goals
3. **Quality Gates** - Enforce at each stage
4. **Parallel Processing** - When tasks are independent
5. **Session Management** - Track state and costs

### Integration
1. **Validate MCP** - Check connections before use
2. **Monitor Costs** - Real-time tracking
3. **Cache Results** - Avoid redundant calls
4. **Log Everything** - Enable debugging
5. **Test Fallbacks** - Ensure recovery paths work
