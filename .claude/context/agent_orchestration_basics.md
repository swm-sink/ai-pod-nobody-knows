# AI Agent Orchestration with Development Acceleration

**Phase:** walk
**Skill Level:** beginner
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for full understanding and initial implementation


## Overview

## Agents overview

**Example:**

**Example:**
Podcast Factory Workers

```bash
1. Research Coordinator üìö
Job: Gathers information about the topic
Tools: Web search, fact checking
Output: Research document
2. Script Writer ‚úçÔ∏è
Job: Turns research into engaging script
Tools: Writing templates, brand voice
Output: Episode script
3. Audio Synthesizer üéôÔ∏è
Job: Converts script to speech
Tools: Voice synthesis AI
Output: Audio file
4. Quality Evaluator ‚úÖ
Job: Checks if everything is good
Tools: Quality metrics, checklists
Output: Pass/fail + suggestions
```

Each agent has a clear, single responsibility and produces specific outputs that feed into the next stage of the pipeline.


## Orchestration patterns

### Setup Instructions


-

Set up async orchestration environment with proper error handling

-

Create individual agent classes with single responsibilities

-

Implement orchestrator with sequential pipeline management

-

Test complete workflow with cost tracking and quality gates

**Example:**

**Example:**
Basic Orchestration Pattern

```bash
async def orchestrate_episode_production(topic):
# Step 1: Research
research_result = await research_agent.execute(topic)
if not research_result.success:
return handle_error("Research failed")
# Step 2: Script (uses research output)
script_result = await script_agent.execute(research_result.data)
if not script_result.success:
return handle_error("Script failed")
# Step 3: Audio (uses script output)
audio_result = await audio_agent.execute(script_result.data)
if not audio_result.success:
return handle_error("Audio failed")
# Step 4: Quality (checks everything)
quality_result = await quality_agent.evaluate(
research_result, script_result, audio_result
)
return combine_all_results()
```

This demonstrates the core sequential pipeline pattern with error handling at each stage.


**Example:**
Claude Code Enhanced Pattern with Memory and Quality Gates

```bash
async def orchestrate_episode_production_enhanced(topic):
# Claude Code: Load project context and patterns
context = await claude_code.load_project_memory()
# Step 1: Research with memory-aware optimization
research_result = await research_agent.execute(
topic,
context=context.research_patterns,
quality_gates=context.research_quality_gates
)
# Claude Code: Update research patterns based on results
await claude_code.update_research_memory(research_result)
if not research_result.success:
# Claude Code: Intelligent error analysis
error_analysis = await claude_code.analyze_failure(
"research", research_result.error
)
return handle_error_with_learning("Research failed", error_analysis)
# Continue with enhanced script, audio, and quality stages...
# Each stage includes Claude Code integration for learning and optimization
```

Advanced pattern includes memory integration, automated quality gates, cost tracking, and pattern learning for continuous improvement.


**Example:**
Agent doing too much (violates single responsibility)

```bash
class DoEverythingAgent:
def execute(self, topic):
# Research AND write AND synthesize
# Too complex! Don't do this.
research = self.research(topic)
script = self.write_script(research)
audio = self.synthesize_audio(script)
return audio
```

This violates the single responsibility principle and makes testing, debugging, and optimization much more difficult. Keep agents focused on one task.


## Key concepts

**Example:**

**Example:**
State Management

```bash
class ProductionState:
current_stage = "research"  # or "script", "audio", "quality"
stages_completed = []
errors_encountered = []
total_cost = 0.0
start_time = datetime.now()
```

Track workflow progress, costs, and errors to enable recovery and optimization.


**Example:**
Error Recovery with Exponential Backoff

```bash
async def execute_with_retry(agent, data, max_retries=3):
for attempt in range(max_retries):
try:
result = await agent.execute(data)
if result.success:
return result
except Exception as e:
if attempt == max_retries - 1:
raise
await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

Implement resilient error recovery with progressive delays to handle temporary failures gracefully.


**Example:**
Cost Tracking Integration

```bash
class AgentResult:
def __init__(self):
self.success = False
self.data = {}
self.cost = 0.0  # Track this!
self.duration = 0.0
def add_api_cost(self, api_name, tokens_used):
rates = {
"claude": 0.003,      # per 1K tokens
"perplexity": 0.005,  # per query
"elevenlabs": 0.001   # per minute
}
self.cost += rates[api_name] * tokens_used
```

Every agent operation tracks costs to enable budget monitoring and optimization decisions.


```bash

```bash

```bash
All agents load without errors, error recovery tests pass, cost tracking validates within budget

## Learning progression

### Setup Instructions
