            <technical-explanation>
                Claude Code's command system provides structured, reusable workflows that accelerate AI development by encapsulating complex operations into simple, memorable commands - particularly powerful for multi-agent orchestration systems where consistent testing and monitoring are critical.

                Commands transform complex AI development workflows into simple, repeatable actions that maintain project context and accelerate iterative development cycles.
            </technical-explanation>
            <simple-explanation>
                Think of commands like having a personal assistant who knows exactly how to do complex tasks for your AI project - instead of explaining how to test your agents every time, you just say "/test-agents" and it handles all the details perfectly, remembering your preferences and project context.

                Like having specialized tools - each command is designed for a specific type of AI development task, from testing agents to optimizing costs.
