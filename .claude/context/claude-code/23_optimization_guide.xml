            <technical-explanation>
                Performance optimization in AI orchestration involves systematic optimization of context window usage, memory management, parallel processing through subagents, caching strategies, and response time improvements using Claude Code's advanced features like thinking modes, hooks, and MCP integration.

                The goal is achieving maximum speed and efficiency while maintaining quality and reliability in complex multi-agent AI workflows.
            </technical-explanation>
            <simple-explanation>
                Think of this like tuning a race car - you start with a working car (your AI agents), then you optimize every component: the engine (thinking modes), the aerodynamics (context efficiency), the pit crew coordination (parallel processing), and the race strategy (caching and monitoring) to achieve maximum speed while maintaining reliability.

                It's about making your AI workflows as fast and efficient as possible without sacrificing quality.
