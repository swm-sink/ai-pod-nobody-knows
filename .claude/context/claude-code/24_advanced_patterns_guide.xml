            <technical-explanation>
                Advanced AI orchestration involves coordinating multiple specialized agents with different capabilities, error handling, and optimization loops. Each agent operates within a defined context with specific interfaces and fallback mechanisms, creating sophisticated production workflows that can adapt, recover, and optimize autonomously.

                These patterns represent the cutting edge of AI development, combining all Claude Code features into integrated systems that approach the complexity and capability of professional AI platforms.
            </technical-explanation>
            <simple-explanation>
                Think of it like conducting an orchestra - each musician (agent) has their part, but the conductor (your orchestration system) ensures they work together perfectly, recovers when someone makes a mistake, and adapts the performance in real-time.

                These are the advanced techniques that separate expert AI developers from beginners - patterns that create truly intelligent, self-managing AI systems.
