                Thinking modes optimization involves strategic computational resource allocation
                across hierarchical reasoning levels. Claude Code implements four distinct
                thinking modes with progressive token budgets (4K to 31,999 tokens), enabling
                fine-tuned quality-cost tradeoffs in multi-agent systems. This optimization
                layer exists exclusively in Claude Code CLI preprocessing and is unavailable
                in web or API interfaces.
            </technical-explanation>
            <simple-explanation>
                Think of thinking modes like adjusting your brain's focus level for different
                problems. Just like you might think quickly for simple math but deeply for
                important life decisions, Claude Code lets you control how much mental energy
                each AI agent uses. More thinking power costs more, but gives better results
                for complex problems.

                Claude Code implements four hierarchical thinking modes with specific computational budgets.
                Each mode allocates different token limits for reasoning processes, enabling progressive
                resource scaling based on problem complexity and quality requirements.
