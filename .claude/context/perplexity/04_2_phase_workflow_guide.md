# 2-Phase Research Workflow Guide - Deep Research → Reasoning Analysis

## Research Metadata
- **Created**: 2025-08-21
- **Purpose**: Operational guide for executing 2-phase Perplexity research workflow
- **Focus**: Phase 1 (Sonar Deep Research) → Phase 2 (Sonar Reasoning) process optimization
- **Context**: Agent enhancement research methodology with cost optimization

---

## Workflow Overview

### Research Philosophy
**Technical**: The 2-phase workflow maximizes research depth in Phase 1 through exhaustive source analysis, then applies strategic reasoning in Phase 2 for implementation-focused analysis, optimizing both research quality and cost efficiency.

**Simple**: Like building a house - first you do comprehensive foundation research (Phase 1), then you create architectural plans based on that research (Phase 2).

**Connection**: This teaches systematic research methodology, strategic analysis techniques, and cost-optimized AI workflow design.
