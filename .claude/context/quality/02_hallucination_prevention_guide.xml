    <section type="introduction" id="anti-hallucination-policy">
      <technical-explanation>
        Hallucination prevention implements systematic validation workflows to prevent AI generation of plausible but incorrect information. The policy enforces evidence-based claims, source attribution, and transparent uncertainty acknowledgment to maintain information integrity and user trust.
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        Think of anti-hallucination like being a really good fact-checker - you never say something is true unless you can prove it, and you're honest when you're not sure about something. It's like having a rule that you can't tell someone a "fact" unless you can show them where you learned it.
      </simple-explanation>
    </section>

    <section type="implementation" id="prevention-strategies">
      <technical-explanation>
        Core prevention strategies include Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for external knowledge grounding, uncertainty acknowledgment for transparent confidence communication, and direct quote grounding for verifiable source attribution. These techniques reduce hallucination rates by 75% according to 2025 research studies.
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        Like having three safety nets when walking a tightrope - first you look up facts before speaking (RAG), then you admit when you're not sure (uncertainty), and finally you show the exact words that support what you're saying (quotes). Multiple safety checks mean fewer mistakes.
      </simple-explanation>

      <examples>
        <example type="basic">
          <scenario>RAG Implementation for API Documentation</scenario>
          <implementation>Search authoritative sources first → Extract relevant information → Generate based on retrieved facts → Cite sources in output</implementation>
          <explanation>Like doing homework by reading the textbook first instead of guessing - much more accurate results</explanation>
        </example>
        <example type="intermediate">
          <scenario>Uncertainty Acknowledgment for Performance Claims</scenario>
          <implementation>If confidence &lt; 80%, use phrases like "I'm not certain" or "I need to verify this"</implementation>
          <explanation>Like a good teacher saying "Let me look that up" instead of guessing wrong information</explanation>
        </example>
        <example type="advanced">
          <scenario>Direct Quote Grounding for Technical Specifications</scenario>
          <implementation>Find word-for-word quotes supporting claims → If no quote exists, retract the claim → Build responses from verified quotes</implementation>
          <explanation>Like being a detective who only draws conclusions from actual evidence you can point to</explanation>
        </example>
      </examples>
    </section>

    <section type="implementation" id="validation-workflow">
      <technical-explanation>
        The mandatory validation workflow implements a five-step process: Identify Claims, Research Validation (3-10 searches), Cross-Reference sources, Citation Requirements, and Confidence Disclosure. Each step has specific criteria and decision trees for systematic fact verification.
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        Like having a checklist for double-checking your work - identify what needs checking, research it thoroughly, compare different sources, write down where you found the information, and be honest about how sure you are.
      </simple-explanation>

      <instructions>
        <step number="1" validation-command="grep -c 'factual.*claim' claims_analysis.txt">Identify all statements that assert facts (statistics, events, specifications)</step>
        <step number="2" validation-command="wc -l search_results.txt | awk '$1 >= 3 {print &quot;Minimum research completed&quot;}'">Conduct 3-10 searches with adaptive rules for conflicting information</step>
        <step number="3" validation-command="python3 validate_cross_references.py sources.json">Compare information across sources using decision tree logic</step>
        <step number="4" validation-command="grep -E 'Source:.*URL.*Date:' final_content.md">Ensure every factual claim includes source URL and access date</step>
        <step number="5" validation-command="grep -E 'confidence.*[0-9]+%' confidence_disclosure.txt">Disclose confidence levels using standard ranges (90-100%, 70-89%, 50-69%, &lt;50%)</step>
      </instructions>

      <validation>
        <validation-command>python3 check_validation_completeness.py content.md</validation-command>
        <validation-command>grep -c "confidence.*uncertain" content.md</validation-command>
        <success-criteria>All factual claims have source citations</success-criteria>
        <success-criteria>Confidence levels disclosed for uncertain information</success-criteria>
        <success-criteria>Minimum 3 sources for technical specifications</success-criteria>
        <success-criteria>Uncertainty acknowledged when confidence &lt; 80%</success-criteria>
      </validation>
    </section>

    <section type="reference" id="research-categories">
      <technical-explanation>
        Research requirements vary by information category: Technical Specifications (3 sources, 2-year recency), Statistics (2 primary sources, original study citation), Best Practices (3-5 sources, context variations noted), Historical Information (2 authoritative sources, cross-checked details).
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        Different types of information need different levels of checking - like how you'd verify a recipe differently than a historical date. Technical stuff needs recent sources, statistics need the original studies, best practices need multiple expert opinions.
      </simple-explanation>

      <examples>
        <example type="basic">
          <scenario>Technical Specifications Validation</scenario>
          <implementation>Official documentation + GitHub repos + technical papers, within last 2 years</implementation>
          <explanation>Technology changes fast, so you need current sources from the people who built it</explanation>
        </example>
        <example type="intermediate">
          <scenario>Statistics and Data Validation</scenario>
          <implementation>Find original study + one additional primary source, cite methodology</implementation>
          <explanation>Numbers can be misleading, so you need to see how they were calculated originally</explanation>
        </example>
      </examples>
    </section>

    <section type="troubleshooting" id="hallucination-red-flags">
      <technical-explanation>
        Hallucination red flags include: specific numbers without source citation, absolute statements without qualification, future predictions stated as facts, fabricated untested examples, and false attribution without verification. Each flag has specific remediation actions.
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        Warning signs that information might be made up - like when someone gives you very specific numbers but can't tell you where they got them, or when they say something will "always" or "never" happen without any exceptions.
      </simple-explanation>

      <examples>
        <example type="anti-pattern">
          <scenario>Red Flag: Specific Numbers Without Source</scenario>
          <implementation>WRONG: "increases performance by 40%" - RIGHT: "increases performance by 40% (Source: benchmark study XYZ, 2025)"</implementation>
          <explanation>Specific numbers sound authoritative but are often the most likely to be hallucinated</explanation>
        </example>
        <example type="anti-pattern">
          <scenario>Red Flag: Absolute Statements</scenario>
          <implementation>WRONG: "always works" - RIGHT: "typically works in most cases, with some exceptions"</implementation>
          <explanation>Real world rarely has absolutes - adding nuance makes claims more accurate</explanation>
        </example>
      </examples>
    </section>

    <section type="advanced" id="claude-code-automation">
      <technical-explanation>
        Claude Code automation enhancements integrate thinking mode escalation, MCP web-search integration, hooks automation, and parallel fact-checking subagents. Automated escalation rules adjust thinking modes based on confidence levels and claim complexity for appropriate validation depth.
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        Like having smart assistants that automatically use more brainpower for harder problems and get help from specialists when needed. The system gets more careful and thorough when dealing with important or uncertain information.
      </simple-explanation>

      <examples>
        <example type="advanced">
          <scenario>Automated Thinking Mode Escalation</scenario>
          <implementation>If confidence &lt; 60% → ultrathink mode, if safety-critical → maximum validation with expert sources</implementation>
          <explanation>Like automatically calling in experts when dealing with difficult or dangerous situations</explanation>
        </example>
        <example type="advanced">
          <scenario>Parallel Fact-Checking Subagents</scenario>
          <implementation>Multiple specialized agents verify different aspects simultaneously: authority, recency, bias, cross-references</implementation>
          <explanation>Like having a team of specialists each check different parts of the information at the same time</explanation>
        </example>
      </examples>
    </section>

    <section type="reference" id="uncertainty-language">
      <technical-explanation>
        Uncertainty language provides standardized phrases for different confidence levels: high uncertainty ("I don't have reliable information"), medium uncertainty ("Sources suggest but don't confirm"), and qualified statements ("According to [source]", "As of [date]").
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        Having the right words to be honest about what you know and don't know - like having a vocabulary for different levels of "I'm not sure" instead of pretending to know everything.
      </simple-explanation>

      <examples>
        <example type="basic">
          <scenario>High Uncertainty Expression</scenario>
          <implementation>"I don't have reliable information about this specific claim - let me research it properly first"</implementation>
          <explanation>Better to admit you don't know than to guess and be wrong</explanation>
        </example>
        <example type="basic">
          <scenario>Qualified Statement with Source</scenario>
          <implementation>"According to the 2025 FastAPI documentation, the default timeout is 30 seconds"</implementation>
          <explanation>Shows exactly where the information comes from and when it was accurate</explanation>
        </example>
      </examples>
