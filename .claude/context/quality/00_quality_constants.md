## üéØ Quality Thresholds

```yaml
CONTENT_QUALITY:
  accuracy: 0.95  # No hallucinated facts
  comprehension: 0.85  # Clear understanding
  engagement: 0.80  # Holds attention
  brand_consistency: 0.90  # Matches voice/tone
  technical_quality: 0.85  # Audio/production standards
  
VALIDATION_SCORES:
  minimum_passing: 0.80
  target_score: 0.85
  excellent_score: 0.90

  0.9: "Excellent - minor refinements only"
  0.8: "Good - meets standards"
  0.7: "Acceptable - some improvements needed"
  0.6: "Below standard - significant work required"
