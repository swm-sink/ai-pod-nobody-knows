# Documentation Governance Controls

**Purpose**: Maintain documentation quality, prevent sprawl, and enforce educational standards
**Authority**: Pre-commit hooks with automated enforcement
**Updated**: 2025-08-30

## üéØ Governance Framework

**Technical:** Comprehensive quality assurance system implementing automated validation, content standards, and lifecycle management to maintain optimal documentation architecture within production constraints.

**Simple:** Like having strict but fair rules for creating documentation - everything must be useful, well-written, and teach something valuable, or it doesn't get added to the project.

**Connection:** This teaches enterprise-grade documentation governance and automated quality assurance patterns.

---

## üìã Core Governance Principles

### 1. Educational Mandate (ENFORCED)
**Feynman Rule**: Every document must include dual explanations
- **Technical**: Professional explanation with industry terminology
- **Simple**: "Think of it like..." analogy-based explanation
- **Connection**: "This helps you learn..." transferable skills

**Validation**: Pre-commit hook scans for educational patterns
```bash
# Educational validation (automated)
grep -E "(Technical|Simple|Connection):" "$file" || exit 1
```

### 2. Single Source of Truth (ZERO TOLERANCE)
**DRY Enforcement**: Each topic covered in exactly ONE location
- **Detection**: Automated duplicate content scanning
- **Prevention**: Pre-commit hooks block duplicate creation
- **Resolution**: Consolidation required before any commits

### 3. File Limits (AUTOMATED)
**Context Architecture**: Strict limits prevent cognitive overload
- `.claude/context/`: 15 files maximum (ENFORCED)
- `.claude/processes/`: 5 active files only
- `.claude/agents/`: 20 production agents maximum
- `.claude/docs/`: 15 essential documentation files

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gates

### Pre-Creation Validation
**Triggers**: Any new `.md` file creation in governed directories

**Checks Performed**:
1. **Directory Limits**: Verify under file count limits
2. **Naming Convention**: Must follow established patterns
3. **Purpose Justification**: Require explicit documentation need
4. **Existing Content**: Check for consolidation opportunities

### Content Quality Standards

#### Required Elements (VALIDATED)
```yaml
mandatory_sections:
  - purpose_statement: "Clear operational purpose"
  - technical_explanation: "Professional terminology"
  - simple_explanation: "Analogy-based understanding"
  - learning_connection: "Transferable skills identification"
  - updated_timestamp: "Maintenance tracking"
```

#### Prohibited Patterns (BLOCKED)
```yaml
blocked_patterns:
  - "enhanced-*": "Use existing architecture"
  - "*-backup*": "Version control provides backups"
  - "*-temp*": "No temporary files in documentation"
  - "*-draft*": "Complete before commit"
```

### Post-Creation Monitoring

#### Usage Tracking (AUTOMATED)
- **Access Frequency**: Git log analysis for file access
- **Reference Count**: Cross-file dependency mapping
- **Size Growth**: Token usage monitoring
- **Quality Metrics**: Educational standard compliance

#### Staleness Detection (AUTOMATED)
- **No Access**: 30+ days without git activity
- **Zero References**: No @ references from active files
- **Deprecated Content**: Superseded by newer documentation
- **Quality Degradation**: Educational standards not maintained

## üîÑ Enforcement Mechanisms

### Pre-Commit Hook Integration
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml integration
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: documentation-governance
      name: Documentation governance enforcement
      entry: .claude/governance/documentation-governance-hook.sh
      language: script
      files: '\.md$'
      pass_filenames: true
```

### Automated Quality Checks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Documentation governance hook (excerpt)

for file in "$@"; do
    # Check educational standards
    if ! grep -q "Technical:" "$file" || ! grep -q "Simple:" "$file"; then
        echo "ERROR: $file missing educational dual explanations"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check file size limits
    if [ $(wc -c < "$file") -gt 10240 ]; then  # 10KB limit
        echo "WARNING: $file exceeds size limit (consider splitting)"
    fi

    # Validate naming conventions
    if [[ "$file" =~ enhanced-.*\.md$ ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Enhanced-* pattern prohibited in $file"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

### Directory-Specific Governance

#### `.claude/context/` (Core Learning Materials)
**Creation Rules**:
- Must consolidate with existing files first
- Requires explicit learning objective
- Educational dual explanations mandatory
- Token budget must be justified

**Quality Requirements**:
- Operational purpose clearly defined
- Transferable skills explicitly stated
- Professional terminology with analogies
- Regular usage or archival

#### `.claude/processes/` (Active Procedures)
**Creation Rules**:
- Maximum 5 active files (hard limit)
- Must replace completed processes
- Immediate archival of completed work
- Clear execution instructions

**Quality Requirements**:
- Step-by-step procedures
- Success criteria defined
- Error handling documented
- Results validation included

#### `.claude/agents/` (Production Specifications)
**Creation Rules**:
- Maximum 20 agents (architectural limit)
- Must justify new agent need
- Integration with existing architecture
- Production-ready specifications only

**Quality Requirements**:
- Clear operational purpose
- MCP tool inheritance documented
- Input/output specifications
- Educational value demonstrated

## üìä Governance Metrics

### Quality Indicators (TRACKED)
```yaml
documentation_health:
  educational_compliance: ">95%"    # Files with dual explanations
  reference_density: ">0.3"        # Average references per file
  size_efficiency: "<5KB average"  # Token optimization
  staleness_rate: "<5%"            # Files unused >30 days
  duplication_violations: "0"       # Zero tolerance
```

### Governance Effectiveness
```yaml
process_metrics:
  creation_blocked: "Count of prevented bad files"
  archival_rate: "Stale files archived per week"
  consolidation_success: "Duplicate content eliminated"
  quality_improvement: "Educational standard adoption"
```
