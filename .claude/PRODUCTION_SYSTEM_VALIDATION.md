# 🎯 PRODUCTION SYSTEM VALIDATION REPORT

## ✅ SYSTEM COMPONENTS VALIDATED

### 📋 Current Inventory
- **13 Agents**: All with correct model references (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- **5 Commands**: Essential orchestration commands only
- **5 Hooks**: Fixed with absolute paths, all functional
- **1 Template**: Complete episode directory structure
- **1 Validator**: NEW speech-to-text validation loop

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

#### 1. ✅ Hook System Fixed
- **Problem**: Relative paths causing "No such file" errors
- **Solution**: Updated all hooks to absolute paths in settings.json
- **Status**: All 5 hooks now functional

#### 2. ✅ Audio Validation Loop Added
- **Problem**: No speech-to-text validation of synthesized audio
- **Solution**: Created `audio-quality-validator` agent with STT access
- **Features**:
  - Word accuracy ≥95% requirement
  - Technical term pronunciation validation
  - Pacing analysis (150-160 WPM)
  - Automatic retry with parameter adjustment

#### 3. ✅ Model References Corrected
- **Problem**: Incorrect Sonnet-4 model identifier
- **Solution**: Updated to correct `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **Scope**: All agents and settings.json updated

#### 4. ✅ Command Orchestration Fixed
- **Problem**: Sub-agents cannot call other sub-agents
- **Solution**: Commands handle all orchestration via Task tool
- **Implementation**: 15-step explicit workflow in `/produce-episode-enhanced`
