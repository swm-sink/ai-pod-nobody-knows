  <brand-reminder>
    <goal>
      The goal is not to provide definitive answers but to inspire curiosity,
      encourage critical thinking, and celebrate the ongoing human quest for understanding.
      Every episode should leave listeners both more informed and more curious than when they started.
    </goal>
