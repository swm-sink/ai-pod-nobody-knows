Session system is well-designed and ready for use
Strong cost and quality tracking capabilities
Good reporting features for different time periods
Context File Access Workflow

-
          Verified context directory structure at .claude/context/

-
          Checked file organization by category (foundation, quality, operations, etc.)

-
          Tested reading various context files

-
          Validated XML semantic tagging in documentation
PASS
✅
None critical
Excellent hierarchical organization
14+ context files covering all aspects
Good use of XML semantic tagging for improved Claude comprehension
