Comprehensive guide for converting existing markdown documentation to XML format using
provided templates and schema, maintaining dual explanations and cross-reference integrity.
This guide explains how to convert existing markdown documentation to XML format using the templates and schema provided.
Educational content, tutorials, step-by-step guides
learning-guide-template.xml
Dual explanations (technical + simple)
Step-by-step instructions with validation
Examples (basic, advanced, anti-pattern)
Learning outcomes and prerequisites
Quick reference, API docs, command references
reference-template.xml
Quick reference sections
Troubleshooting examples
Advanced usage patterns
Validation commands
Configuration values, quality thresholds, system limits
constants-template.xml
Structured constant definitions
Quality gates and thresholds
System limits and constraints
File naming conventions
Domain navigation, learning paths, directory guides
navigation-template.xml
Learning path organization
Priority-based links
Quick start guidance
Cross-domain references

-

Has educational content with explanations
Primarily lookup information and commands
Contains configuration values and thresholds
Directory structure and learning paths

-

Title and Metadata: Extract from headers and frontmatter
Technical/Simple Explanations: Look for dual explanation patterns
Instructions: Extract step-by-step procedures
Examples: Identify code examples and use cases
Cross-references: Note links to other documents

-

Copy appropriate template
Replace {PLACEHOLDER} values with extracted content
Preserve dual explanation structure
Maintain validation commands where present
Update cross-references to point to .xml files

-

Ensure XML is well-formed
Check against schema if possible
Verify all required sections are present
Confirm dual explanations are maintained
**Technical:** Professional explanation...
**Simple:** Analogy-based explanation...
&lt;technical-explanation&gt;
Professional explanation...
&lt;/technical-explanation&gt;
&lt;simple-explanation&gt;
Analogy-based explanation...
&lt;/simple-explanation&gt;
```python
code_example()
```
&lt;example type="basic"&gt;
&lt;scenario&gt;What this example demonstrates&lt;/scenario&gt;
&lt;implementation&gt;code_example()&lt;/implementation&gt;
&lt;explanation&gt;Why this works and what it teaches&lt;/explanation&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
See [Other Guide](path/other-guide.md)
&lt;cross-references&gt;
&lt;reference file="other-guide.md" section="relevant-section" type="related"&gt;
Other Guide reference description
&lt;/reference&gt;
&lt;/cross-references&gt;
Document type correctly identified
All placeholders replaced with actual content
Dual explanations preserved (technical + simple)
Validation commands included where applicable
Examples categorized appropriately (basic/advanced/anti-pattern)
Cross-references updated to .xml files
XML is well-formed and validates against schema
Educational requirements maintained
Use meaningful element names that describe content purpose
Group related content in logical sections
Maintain consistent nesting levels
Include metadata for automated processing
Preserve all original educational value
Maintain existing cross-reference networks
Keep validation commands and examples intact
Ensure technical accuracy is not lost in conversion
Add structured metadata for better searchability
Include learning objectives where missing
Standardize example categorization
Improve navigation chains between documents
Malformed XML structure or unclosed tags
Use XML validator tool and check tag matching
Conversion process merged technical and simple content
Manually separate and tag explanation types
File paths not updated from .md to .xml
Find and replace all .md references with .xml
Command examples not properly extracted and tagged
Review original content for embedded commands
xmllint --noout filename.xml - Check XML structure
grep -o '@[^)]*' filename.xml - Find file references
xmlstarlet val -s schema.xsd filename.xml - Schema validation

```bash

-
        Identify document type and select appropriate template

-
        Read through original content to understand structure

-
        Note any special formatting or embedded elements

-
        Copy template and begin content mapping

-
        Preserve all educational elements and explanations

-
        Update file references and navigation links

-
        Check XML structure and schema compliance

-
        Verify all content is properly categorized

-
        Test navigation links and cross-references

-
        Compare with original for completeness

-
        Ensure educational value is maintained

-
        Validate against quality checklist
markdown-to-xml-converter.py
Extract markdown headers and convert to XML metadata
Identify and preserve dual explanation patterns
Update file references from .md to .xml
Generate basic XML structure from template
