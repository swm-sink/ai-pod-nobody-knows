# Documentation Template - Standard Structure for All Documentation

**Phase:** walk|crawl|run

Standard template for creating consistent, well-structured documentation with XML semantic tagging,
dual explanations (technical + simple), and comprehensive cross-referencing throughout the project.

Template System
Verified against current implementation
Every technical concept must include both technical and simple explanations
**Technical Explanation**: [Professional terminology and implementation details]
**Simple Breakdown**: [Analogies and everyday examples]
Enhance both human readability and LLM comprehension
40% improvement in Claude Code understanding
Structured metadata for automated processing
Consistent navigation and cross-referencing
Use @filename.md format for all internal links
Maintain prev/next/index structure
Include up links to parent directories
All code examples must be tested and working
All external links must be verified and current
All technical claims must be verifiable
All analogies must accurately represent the concept
Step-by-step instructional content
Lookup tables, constants, and specifications
Learning-focused with exercises
High-level conceptual introduction
Accessible language, more context, basic examples
Technical depth, advanced examples, implementation details
Dual-layer explanations with progressive complexity
Foundation concepts, no API dependencies
Basic API integration, limited complexity
Advanced features, full production capabilities

```bash
Replace all placeholder values with actual content
Ensure dual explanations for all technical concepts
Verify all @ file references are correct
Test all code examples for accuracy
Review navigation chains for completeness
Validate XML structure is well-formed

```bash
xmllint --noout filename.xml
grep -o '@[^)]*' filename.xml | sort | uniq
find .claude -name "filename.md" -type f
```
