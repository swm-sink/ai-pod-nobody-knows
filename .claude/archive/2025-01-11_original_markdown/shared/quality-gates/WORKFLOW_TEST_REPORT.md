### 4. Context File Access Workflow

**Test Steps Performed:**
1. ✅ Verified context directory structure at `.claude/context/`
2. ✅ Checked file organization by category (foundation, quality, operations, etc.)
3. ✅ Tested reading various context files
4. ✅ Validated XML semantic tagging in documentation

**Result: PASS** ✅

**Issues Found:** None critical

**Context Organization:**
- Excellent hierarchical organization
- 14+ context files covering all aspects
- Good use of XML semantic tagging for improved Claude comprehension
- Clear categorization: foundation, quality, operations, ai-orchestration, claude-code, elevenlabs

**File Structure Quality:**
```
.claude/context/
├── ai-orchestration/     (Agent orchestration concepts)
├── claude-code/          (Claude Code platform guides)
├── elevenlabs/           (Audio synthesis documentation)
├── foundation/           (Core project concepts)
├── operations/           (Daily operations guides)
├── prompts_research/     (Prompt engineering guides)
└── quality/              (Quality control requirements)
```

**Recommendations:**
- Context system is excellent and production-ready
- Good balance of technical depth and accessibility
- XML tagging enhances Claude Code integration
