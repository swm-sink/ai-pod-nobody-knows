# Test: Quality-Evaluator Agent Validation

## Test Objective
Validate that quality-evaluator agent:
1. References all centralized configurations correctly
2. Implements quality gates from JSON accurately
3. Validates brand voice metrics properly
4. Checks audio optimization requirements
5. Outputs to correct directory with proper format

## Configuration References Check ✓

### Files Referenced
- [x] `.claude/shared/config/production-config.yaml`
- [x] `projects/nobody-knows/config/quality_gates.json`
- [x] `.claude/shared/brand/brand-voice-guide.md`
- [x] `.claude/shared/frameworks/audio-optimization.md`
- [x] `.claude/shared/frameworks/progressive-complexity.md`

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Count configuration references
grep -c "shared/\|projects/nobody-knows" quality-evaluator.md
# Expected: 5+ references
```

## Quality Gate Implementation ✓

### Thresholds from quality_gates.json
- [x] Comprehension: 0.85 (weight 0.25)
- [x] Brand Consistency: 0.90 (weight 0.30)
- [x] Engagement: 0.80 (weight 0.25)
- [x] Technical: 0.85 (weight 0.20)
- [x] Overall: 0.85 minimum

### Metrics Tracked
- [x] Flesch reading ease (60-80)
- [x] Flesch-Kincaid grade (8-12)
- [x] Average sentence length (15-25)
- [x] Humility phrases per 1000 words
- [x] Questions per 1000 words
- [x] Hook effectiveness
- [x] Duration accuracy

## Brand Voice Validation ✓

### Metrics from brand-voice-guide.md
- [x] Intellectual humility: 5 target, 3 minimum per 1000 words
- [x] Questions: 4 target, 2 minimum per 1000 words
- [x] Feynman-Fridman style balance check
- [x] Forbidden language pattern detection
- [x] Emotional tone spectrum validation

## Audio Optimization Checks ✓

### Requirements from audio-optimization.md
- [x] Numbers spelled out validation
- [x] Abbreviations expanded check
- [x] Forbidden elements detection
- [x] SSML usage validation (max 3-4 per segment)
- [x] Sentence length compliance (max 25 words)
- [x] No visual references check

## Output Configuration ✓

### Directory and Naming
- [x] Output to: `projects/nobody-knows/output/quality/`
- [x] Naming pattern: `ep{number}_quality_{date}.json`
- [x] JSON format with comprehensive metrics
- [x] Not in `.claude` directory

## Cost Optimization ✓

### Budget Compliance
- [x] Budget: $0.50 maximum
- [x] Model: Haiku (cost-efficient)
- [x] Evaluation time: < 10 minutes
- [x] Cost tracking in output

## Failure Handling ✓

### Specific Actions for Each Failure Type
- [x] Below comprehension: Specific sentence fixes
- [x] Below brand consistency: Phrase additions
- [x] Below engagement: Variety improvements
- [x] Below technical: Duration adjustments

## Integration Protocol ✓

### Input/Output Specifications
- [x] Input from script-writer defined
- [x] Output format specified (JSON)
- [x] Handoff protocol documented
- [x] Pass/fail determination clear

## Test Execution Plan

### Step 1: Configuration Verification
```bash
grep -c "shared/" quality-evaluator.md
# Expected: 5+ references
```

### Step 2: Sample Validation Test
1. Load sample script from `projects/nobody-knows/output/scripts/`
2. Run quality evaluation
3. Verify output location and format
4. Check all metrics calculated correctly

### Step 3: Failure Mode Test
1. Create script with low brand consistency
2. Verify specific feedback provided
3. Check recommendations actionable
4. Confirm retry protocol works

## Expected Results
- Agent properly references all configurations
- Quality gates accurately implemented
- Brand voice metrics correctly calculated
- Audio optimization thoroughly checked
- Output in correct location with proper format
- Cost within budget constraints

## Test Status: READY FOR EXECUTION

The quality-evaluator agent is properly configured with:
- All centralized configurations referenced
- No duplication of quality standards
- Comprehensive validation coverage
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- Actionable feedback generation

**Next Step**: Create validation test script
