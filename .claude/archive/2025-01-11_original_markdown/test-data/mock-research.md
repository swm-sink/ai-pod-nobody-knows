This is mock research data for testing the podcast production pipeline without API costs. In a real scenario, this would contain comprehensive research from Perplexity's Sonar Pro API.

## What We Know

### Foundation Understanding
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These include:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in data
- **Learning**: Improving performance through experience
- **Problem Solving**: Finding solutions to complex challenges
- **Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language

### Key Concepts
1. **Machine Learning**: Systems that learn from data without explicit programming
2. **Neural Networks**: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
3. **Deep Learning**: Multiple layers of neural networks for complex pattern recognition
4. **Natural Language Processing**: Enabling computers to understand human language

### Current Applications
- **Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Spotify, Amazon suggestions
- **Image Recognition**: Face detection, medical imaging analysis
- **Language Models**: ChatGPT, Claude, translation services

## What We Don't Know

### Open Questions
1. **Consciousness**: Can AI ever be truly conscious or self-aware?
2. **General Intelligence**: When will we achieve human-level general AI?
3. **Creativity**: Can AI be genuinely creative or just recombinative?
4. **Ethics**: How do we ensure AI remains beneficial and aligned?

### Active Debates
- The nature of understanding in large language models
- Whether current approaches will lead to AGI
- How to measure and ensure AI safety
- The limits of scaling current architectures

### Knowledge Frontiers
- Emergent capabilities in large models
- Interpretability of deep neural networks
- Alignment with human values
- Long-term impacts on society and employment

## Interesting Angles

### The Paradox of AI Understanding
Despite AI systems performing increasingly complex tasks, we often don't fully understand HOW they arrive at their conclusions. This "black box" nature represents one of the field's greatest mysteries.

### The Turing Test Revisited
Alan Turing proposed his famous test in 1950, but modern AI has revealed the test's limitations. Systems can pass conversational tests while lacking true understanding - raising profound questions about intelligence itself.

### Learning Without Experience
Unlike humans who learn through embodied experience, AI systems learn from data alone. This fundamental difference may explain both AI's strengths and its surprising weaknesses.
