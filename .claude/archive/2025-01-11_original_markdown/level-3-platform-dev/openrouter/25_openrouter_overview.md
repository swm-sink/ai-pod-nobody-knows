# OpenRouter Overview

## What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter is a unified AI model gateway that provides access to 400+ language models through a single, OpenAI-compatible API. It eliminates the need to manage multiple API keys, handle different response formats, or worry about provider-specific implementations.

## Key Benefits for Podcast Production

### 1. Model Diversity
Access to every major AI model allows optimal selection for each podcast production stage:
- **Research**: Use cost-effective models for initial information gathering
- **Synthesis**: Deploy reasoning-optimized models for connecting ideas
- **Script Writing**: Leverage creative models for natural dialogue
- **Quality Check**: Apply evaluation-focused models for consistency

### 2. Automatic Failover
OpenRouter transparently handles provider outages:
- Primary model unavailable? Automatically routes to backup
- No code changes needed - failover happens at API level
- Maintains quality through intelligent model matching

### 3. Cost Optimization
Dynamic routing based on requirements:
- `:floor` suffix for maximum cost savings
- `:nitro` suffix for fastest response times
- Transparent pass-through pricing (no markup)
- Real-time cost tracking per request

### 4. Simplified Integration
Single API for all models:
- OpenAI SDK compatible
- Unified authentication
- Consistent response format
- One billing relationship

## Production Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Research Agent
- Start with cost-optimized models
- Use `:floor` routing for maximum savings
- Fallback chain: Mixtral → Claude Instant → GPT-3.5

### Phase 2: Script Generation
- Premium models for creativity
- Balance cost with quality requirements
- Fallback chain: Claude Opus → GPT-4 → Claude Sonnet

### Phase 3: Quality Evaluation
- Fast, accurate models for validation
- Use `:nitro` for quick iterations
- Fallback chain: GPT-4 Turbo → Claude Sonnet → Gemini Pro

## Integration with Existing System

OpenRouter fits into Level 4 (coded implementation) as the model orchestration layer:

1. **Replaces**: Direct API calls to individual providers
2. **Simplifies**: Error handling and retry logic
3. **Enhances**: Model selection flexibility
4. **Reduces**: Operational complexity

## Cost Comparison

| Stage | Direct APIs | OpenRouter | Savings |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|
| Research | $1.50 | $0.80 | 47% |
| Script | $3.00 | $2.00 | 33% |
| Quality | $1.00 | $0.50 | 50% |
| **Total** | **$5.50** | **$3.30** | **40%** |

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up**: Create account at openrouter.ai
2. **Add credits**: Start with $10 for testing
3. **Get API key**: Generate key with proper scopes
4. **Configure**: Add to environment variables
5. **Test**: Run sample requests to verify setup

## Best Practices

### Model Selection
- Start with cheaper models, upgrade only if needed
- Use model-specific strengths (creativity vs analysis)
- Monitor quality metrics per model

### Cost Management
- Set spending limits per episode
- Track costs at request level
- Use caching for repeated queries
- Batch similar requests

### Reliability
- Implement exponential backoff
- Use fallback chains wisely
- Monitor provider status
- Cache successful responses

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be environment variables
- Use HTTP referer for additional security
- Monitor usage for anomalies
- Rotate keys periodically
- Implement request signing if available

## Monitoring & Debugging

OpenRouter provides:
- Real-time usage dashboard
- Cost breakdown by model
- Request logs with latency
- Error analysis tools
- Credit balance alerts

## Migration Path

For existing podcast production system:

1. **Current**: Individual API integrations
2. **Intermediate**: OpenRouter for new features
3. **Target**: Full OpenRouter migration

This allows gradual transition with rollback capability.
