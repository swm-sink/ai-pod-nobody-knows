        <!-- EMBEDDED PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
        <section type="overview" id="project-definition">
            <technical-explanation>
                This is a hands-on learning project for mastering AI agent orchestration by building an automated podcast production system. The project implements a dual-layer architecture: an AI orchestration system (the product) and Claude Code development platform (the workshop). It emphasizes practical skill development through building real systems rather than theoretical study.
            </technical-explanation>
            <simple-explanation>
                Think of this as your personal AI apprenticeship - you'll learn how to coordinate multiple AI agents to work together by building something real and useful: an automated podcast system. It's like learning carpentry by building furniture instead of just reading about it.

        <section type="phases" id="learning-progression">
            <technical-explanation>
                The learning progression follows a WALK-CRAWL-RUN methodology with progressive complexity introduction. Each phase has specific objectives, time investment levels, and financial commitments to ensure sustainable skill development without overwhelming beginners.
            </technical-explanation>
            <simple-explanation>
                Like learning to drive - first you learn the controls (WALK), then practice in a parking lot (CRAWL), then drive on real roads (RUN). Each step builds on the previous one.
