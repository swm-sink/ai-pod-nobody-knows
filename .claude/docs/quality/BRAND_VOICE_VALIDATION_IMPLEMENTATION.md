## Validation Framework

### Four-Dimensional Scoring System

#### 1. Intellectual Humility Integration (25% weight)
**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Uncertainty acknowledgment: 0.8-1.2 instances per minute
- Humble language patterns: "appears to", "suggests", "current understanding"
- Mystery celebration: Minimum 2 "nobody knows" moments per 15-minute episode
- Expert humanity: Show experts as learners, not infallible authorities

**Scoring Thresholds:**
- **90-100%**: Rich uncertainty language, natural mystery celebration
- **80-89%**: Adequate humility markers, some uncertainty acknowledgment
- **70-79%**: Limited humility language, few uncertainty moments
- **<70%**: Overconfident tone, lacks intellectual humility

#### 2. Learning Celebration Philosophy (25% weight)
**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Curiosity building language: "What's fascinating is", "This opens up questions"
- Wonder expressions: Excitement about discovery (minimum 3 per episode)
- Collaborative positioning: "We're exploring together", "Let's discover"
- Future questions: Forward-looking curiosity about unknowns

#### 3. Accessible Expert Tone (25% weight)
**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Approachability markers: Conversational tone, accessible analogies
- Anti-condescension: No talking down, no expert superiority
- Complexity balance: Technical accuracy with clear explanations
- Inclusive language: "We", "us", "our" versus distancing language

#### 4. Uncertainty Transparency (25% weight)
**Quantitative Metrics:**
- UNVERIFIED marking compliance: Proper marking of unverified claims
- Limitation acknowledgment: Clear knowledge boundaries
- Debate recognition: Ongoing scientific discussions acknowledged
- Source honesty: Transparent evidence quality and consensus levels

## Quality Gate Thresholds

### Decision Matrix
- **≥85%**: **PASS** - Script approved for production pipeline
- **80-84%**: **CONDITIONAL PASS** - Minor revisions recommended
- **75-79%**: **NEEDS REVISION** - Specific improvements required before resubmission
- **<75%**: **FAILS** - Major rework required, return to script-writer with detailed feedback
