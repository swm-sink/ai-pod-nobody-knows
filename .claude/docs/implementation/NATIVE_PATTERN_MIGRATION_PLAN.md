# Native Pattern Migration Plan

## Phase 1: Assessment & Strategy (Day 1)

### Step 1.1: Inventory Non-Native Components
Current violations:
```
.claude/infrastructure/research-storage/search-api.py
.claude/infrastructure/validation-harness.py
```

### Step 1.2: Analyze Functionality
**search-api.py**: Provides research storage and retrieval
**validation-harness.py**: Runs validation checks on system components

### Step 1.3: Migration Strategy Decision

**Technical:** Convert Python implementations to Claude Code native patterns using sub-agents for logic and hooks for automation, maintaining functionality while gaining platform integration benefits.

**Simple:** Like switching from custom-built tools to the workshop's built-in equipment - same job, better integration.

**Connection:** This teaches platform-native development principles and the value of leveraging built-in capabilities over custom solutions.

## Phase 2: Research Storage Migration (Day 2-3)

### Step 2.1: Convert search-api.py to Sub-Agent
Create: `.claude/agents/infrastructure/research-storage-agent.md`

```markdown
---
name: research-storage-agent
description: Manages research data storage and retrieval operations
tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob
---

# Research Storage Agent

## Core Mission
Provide persistent storage and intelligent retrieval of research data across episodes.

## Educational Context

**Technical:** This agent implements a file-based storage pattern with indexed search capabilities, replacing traditional database operations with filesystem operations optimized for Claude Code.

**Simple:** Like a filing cabinet with a really smart assistant who remembers where everything is and can find related items quickly.

**Connection:** This teaches you about storage patterns, indexing strategies, and the trade-offs between different persistence approaches.

## Storage Operations

### Save Research Data
```yaml
operation: save_research
input:
  episode_number: "001"
  research_data: {json_content}

process:
  1. Create indexed filename: ep{number}_research_{timestamp}.json
  2. Save to: projects/nobody-knows/output/research/data/
  3. Update index file with metadata
  4. Create search tags for quick retrieval
```

### Search Research Data
```yaml
operation: search_research
input:
  query: "search terms"
  filters: {episode_range, date_range, topics}

process:
  1. Load research index
  2. Apply filters to narrow search
  3. Use grep for content search
  4. Return ranked results
```

## Implementation
[Rest of agent implementation following template]
```

### Step 2.2: Create Hook for Research Storage
```yaml
# In settings.json hooks configuration
{
  "hooks": {
    "research-storage": {
      "trigger": "post-tool-use",
      "condition": "tool=Write AND path contains 'research'",
      "action": "Invoke research-storage-agent to index new research"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2.3: Remove Python File
```bash
# After verification of sub-agent functionality
git rm .claude/infrastructure/research-storage/search-api.py
git commit -m "feat: migrate research storage to native Claude Code patterns"
```

## Phase 3: Validation Harness Migration (Day 4-5)

### Step 3.1: Convert validation-harness.py to Commands
Create multiple validation commands in `.claude/commands/validation/`

```markdown
# /validate-agents - Agent Validation Command

Validates all agents meet quality and compliance standards.

## Usage
/validate-agents [options]

## Process
Use the validation-orchestrator sub-agent to check all agents for:
- Proper YAML frontmatter
- Required tools specification
- Educational compliance (dual explanations)
- Integration points documentation
- Cost tracking implementation

## Output
Validation report with:
- Compliance score per agent
- Specific issues found
- Remediation suggestions
- Overall system health score
```

### Step 3.2: Create Validation Sub-Agent
`.claude/agents/infrastructure/validation-orchestrator.md`

```markdown
---
name: validation-orchestrator
description: Orchestrates comprehensive system validation checks
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Validation Orchestrator

## Educational Context

**Technical:** Implements a rules-based validation engine using pattern matching and structural analysis to ensure system components meet quality standards.

**Simple:** Like a quality inspector with a detailed checklist who examines every part of the system to ensure it meets specifications.

**Connection:** This teaches you about automated quality assurance, validation patterns, and the importance of systematic verification in complex systems.

## Validation Suites

### Agent Validation
- Check YAML frontmatter structure
- Verify educational compliance
- Validate tool specifications
- Assess integration documentation

### Command Validation
- Verify command structure
- Check argument handling
- Validate help documentation
- Test execution paths

### Configuration Validation
- Schema compliance checking
- Value range validation
- Cross-reference verification
- Dependency checking

[Implementation details following template]
```

### Step 3.3: Create Validation Hooks
```yaml
# Pre-push validation hook
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-push-validation": {
      "trigger": "pre-push",
      "action": "/validate-all",
      "blocking": true,
      "failure-message": "Validation failed. Fix issues before pushing."
    }
  }
}
```

## Phase 4: Infrastructure Cleanup (Day 6)

### Step 4.1: Remove Infrastructure Directory
```bash
# After all migrations verified
git rm -r .claude/infrastructure/
git commit -m "refactor: complete migration to Claude Code native patterns"
```

### Step 4.2: Update Documentation
Remove references to Python infrastructure:
- Update STRUCTURE.md
- Update README.md
- Update any setup guides

### Step 4.3: Create Migration Guide
Document the migration for future reference:
- What was migrated
- How functionality was preserved
- Benefits gained from native patterns

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Day 7)

### Step 5.1: Functional Testing
- Test research storage operations
- Verify search functionality
- Run all validation suites
- Confirm no functionality lost

### Step 5.2: Performance Comparison
- Measure operation speed
- Check resource usage
- Validate cost efficiency
- Document improvements

### Step 5.3: Integration Testing
- Run full production pipeline
- Verify hooks trigger correctly
- Check command execution
- Validate system stability

## Phase 6: Documentation & Training (Day 8)

### Step 6.1: Update System Documentation
- Document native patterns used
- Explain migration rationale
- Provide usage examples
- Create troubleshooting guide

### Step 6.2: Create Best Practices Guide
- When to use sub-agents vs commands
- Hook pattern recommendations
- Native pattern advantages
- Migration strategies for future components
