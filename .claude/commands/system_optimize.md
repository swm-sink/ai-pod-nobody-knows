Execute cross-project optimization and learning: $ARGUMENTS

USAGE: /system:optimize [optional:focus_area]

FOCUS AREAS:
- cost: Optimize for cost efficiency
- quality: Improve quality metrics
- speed: Enhance production speed
- all: Comprehensive optimization (default)

OPTIMIZATION PROCESS:
1. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Identify successful patterns across projects
   - Extract high-performing configurations
   - Detect common failure modes

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Compare cost-per-episode across projects
   - Identify inefficient API usage
   - Recommend budget reallocations

3. **Quality Improvements**
   - Share successful brand voice patterns
   - Cross-pollinate engagement techniques
   - Update quality thresholds

4. **Workflow Efficiency**
   - Optimize agent orchestration
   - Improve parallel processing
   - Reduce redundant operations

EXAMPLE:
/system:optimize cost

OUTPUT:
```
