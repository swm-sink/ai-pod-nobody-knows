# /research-batch-10 - Simple 10-Episode Research Batch

**Technical:** Native Claude Code batch processing using existing research infrastructure to sequentially research 10 episodes with automatic progress tracking and cost monitoring via existing hooks system.

**Simple:** Like running your proven research process 10 times in a row, keeping track of where you are and how much you've spent.

**Connection:** This teaches batch processing fundamentals and operational consistency essential for scalable content production.

## Usage

```
/research-batch-10 [starting_episode_number]
```

## Example

```
/research-batch-10 1    # Research episodes 1-10
/research-batch-10 11   # Research episodes 11-20
```

## Implementation

I will research 10 consecutive episodes using the existing `/research-episode-enhanced` command:

For episodes $ARGUMENTS to $ARGUMENTS+9:

1. **Load Episode Topic**: Read from `projects/nobody-knows/series_plan/episodes_master.json`
2. **Execute Research**: Use existing `/research-episode-enhanced [episode_number] [topic]`
3. **Progress Tracking**: Simple count (Episode X of 10 completed)
4. **Cost Monitoring**: Existing hooks track costs automatically
5. **Continue**: Move to next episode

## Session Structure

Episodes will be researched in individual sessions following existing patterns:
```
sessions/ep_001_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/research/
sessions/ep_002_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/research/
...
sessions/ep_010_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/research/
```

## Progress Report

After each episode completion:
- âœ… Episode X: [TOPIC] - $Y.YY cost - Quality: Z.ZZ
- ðŸ”„ Progress: X/10 episodes completed
- ðŸ’° Batch cost: $XX.XX total

## Benefits

**Simple**: Uses existing proven research workflow 10 times
**Native**: Pure Claude Code patterns - no external orchestration
**Reliable**: Leverages tested research agents and quality gates
**Trackable**: Clear progress and cost visibility throughout batch

Ready to research 10 episodes using existing native Claude Code infrastructure.
