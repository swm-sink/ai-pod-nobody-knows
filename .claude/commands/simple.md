# /research-simple - Direct Main Chat Research

**Technical:** Simplified research workflow using main chat orchestration with direct MCP tool access, avoiding Task delegation architectural limitations discovered through systematic debugging.
**Simple:** Like doing research yourself instead of asking someone else to do it - you have direct access to all the tools and information sources.
**Connection:** This teaches the principle of working with architectural constraints rather than against them, choosing the simplest solution that actually works.

## Research Process for Episode: $ARGUMENTS

Let me conduct comprehensive research for this episode using our available MCP tools:

### Phase 1: Initial Research
Using Perplexity to gather current information on the topic as of August 22, 2025:

```
Research Query: "$ARGUMENTS current developments research trends 2025 latest findings"
```

### Phase 2: Deep Investigation
Follow-up research to explore specific aspects and validate findings:

```
Research Query: "$ARGUMENTS expert perspectives academic research peer reviewed studies"
```

### Phase 3: Narrative Development
Generate engaging questions and narrative structure:

```
Research Query: "$ARGUMENTS storytelling approaches educational content intellectual humility"
```

### Phase 4: Source Validation
Use WebSearch to cross-reference and validate key claims:

```
Web Search: "$ARGUMENTS authoritative sources fact checking verification"
```

### Phase 5: Research Package Creation
Synthesize all findings into a comprehensive research package ready for script development.

**Note**: This command performs all research directly in main chat using available MCP tools (Perplexity and WebSearch) rather than delegating to sub-agents, based on debugging findings that revealed architectural isolation of Task-delegated agents from MCP tools.
