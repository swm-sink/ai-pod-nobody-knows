# /produce-episode-native - Native Claude Code Production Workflow

## 🚨 PRODUCTION-OPTIMIZED WITH EMPIRICAL DATA - Episode 1 Validated

**Date**: August 25, 2025
**Source**: Episode 1 production validation - $2.77 actual cost, 11-minute duration
**Impact**: All production parameters recalibrated based on ElevenLabs 206 WPM empirical rate

Execute comprehensive episode production for a "Nobody Knows" podcast using Claude Code native orchestration patterns with empirically validated production parameters and direct API integration.

## Usage

```bash
/produce-episode-native [episode_number] [--from-research] [--validate-freshness]
```

## Examples

```bash
/produce-episode-native 1 --from-research
/produce-episode-native 25 --validate-freshness
```

## Native Claude Code Orchestration

This command demonstrates proper Claude Code architecture where **the main chat acts as orchestrator** and uses the **Task tool** to delegate to specialized production agents, rather than using separate orchestrator agents (which violate native patterns).

### Production Workflow Architecture

**Native Pattern (This Command)**:
```
Main Chat → Task tool → Specialized production agents
```

**Anti-Pattern (Avoided)**:
```
Main Chat → Production Orchestrator Agent → Sub-agents
```

## Production Pipeline Execution

I will coordinate the complete production pipeline using Task tool delegation:

### Prerequisites Validation
```
Before starting, I will verify:
- Research stream completed: sessions/ep_{number}_{timestamp}/research/research_complete.json exists
- Research package approved by user (if --from-research flag used)
- Production session directory ready: sessions/ep_{number}_{timestamp}/production/
- All quality gates and cost tracking systems operational
```

### Step 1: Initialize Production Session
```
Create production session directory: sessions/ep_{number}_{timestamp}/production/
Set up tracking for five-agent production workflow
Initialize cost tracking and quality gates
Load research package if using --from-research flag
```

### Step 2: Task Delegation to Episode Planner Agent
```
Use Task tool to delegate to episode-planner:

INPUT: Research package (if available) or episode topic
REQUIREMENTS:
- Create detailed episode structure and timing blueprint
- Integrate research findings into narrative flow
- Design 25-30 minute episode architecture (206 WPM empirical rate)
- Ensure intellectual humility brand alignment
- Generate episode plan with segment timing
- Save episode_plan.json with complete structure
```

### Step 3: Task Delegation to Script Writer Agent
```
Use Task tool to delegate to script-writer (enhanced):

INPUT: Episode plan + research data package
REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate initial 3,200-3,600 word script draft (206 WPM = 25-30 minutes)
- Target 17,500-19,500 characters (including SSML markup)
- Integrate research insights and expert quotes
- Maintain "Nobody Knows" brand voice throughout
- Include intellectual humility theme elements
- Structure for 25-30 minute target duration with empirical validation
- Create engaging, accessible content
- Save script_draft.md with complete script
```

### Step 4: Parallel Task Delegation to Quality Evaluation Agents
```
Simultaneously delegate to dual quality agents:

AGENT A - Use Task tool to delegate to quality-claude:
- Evaluate script for brand consistency (>85% threshold - empirically achievable)
- Assess technical accuracy and comprehension
- Check engagement and educational value
- Validate intellectual humility alignment
- Generate quality_claude_report.json

AGENT B - Use Task tool to delegate to quality-gemini:
- Independent quality assessment and validation
- Cross-verify brand voice consistency (>85% composite score - Episode 1 validated)
- Evaluate production readiness metrics
- Assess accessibility and engagement
- Generate quality_gemini_report.json
```

### Step 5: Task Delegation to Feedback Synthesis Agent
```
Use Task tool to delegate to feedback-synthesizer:

INPUT: Both quality evaluation reports
REQUIREMENTS:
- Consolidate quality evaluations into unified feedback
- Prioritize improvement recommendations by impact
- Generate consensus-based improvement plan
- Identify critical issues requiring script revision
- Create feedback_synthesis.json with actionable guidance
```

### Step 6: Task Delegation to Script Polisher Agent
```
Use Task tool to delegate to script-polisher:

INPUT: Script draft + consolidated feedback + research package
REQUIREMENTS:
- Address all critical quality issues identified
- Refine script based on dual evaluation feedback
- Maintain brand voice while improving quality
- Optimize for TTS synthesis compatibility
- Ensure 27-minute target duration maintained
- Generate script_final.md ready for audio production
```

### Step 7: Task Delegation to TTS Optimizer Agent
```
Use Task tool to delegate to tts-optimizer:

INPUT: Final polished script
REQUIREMENTS:
- Optimize script for ElevenLabs TTS synthesis using empirical effectiveness data
- Add strategic SSML markup: 1s+ breaks (95% effective) vs 500ms breaks (40% effective)
- Add IPA phoneme tags for all expert names and technical terms (100% pronunciation accuracy)
- Optimize pacing, pronunciation, and flow using Episode 1 lessons learned
- Use Amelia voice parameters: stability=0.65, similarity=0.8, style=0.3
- Generate tts_optimized_script.ssml ready for direct API synthesis
```

### Step 8: Task Delegation to Audio Synthesizer Agent
```
Use Task tool to delegate to audio-synthesizer:

INPUT: TTS-optimized script with SSML markup
REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate final episode audio using ElevenLabs DIRECT API (MCP fallback documented as unreliable)
- Use production-validated single-call synthesis method
- Apply Amelia voice settings: stability=0.65, similarity=0.8, style=0.3, speed=1.0
- Validate audio duration (25-30 minutes target - 206 WPM empirical rate)
- Ensure professional audio quality standards (94.89% word accuracy achievable)
- Save episode_audio.mp3 with metadata and cost tracking ($2.77 Episode 1 actual)
```

### Step 9: Final Quality Validation & Session Completion
```
Coordinate final validation:
- Validate all production stages completed successfully
- Verify audio meets duration and quality targets
- Aggregate cost tracking across all agents
- Generate comprehensive production report
- Create user-deliverable package with all outputs
```

## Quality Gates Integration

## Error Recovery & Resilience

### Error Handling Protocol
If any production stage fails:
1. **Save Current Progress**: Persist all completed stage outputs
2. **Log Specific Failure Reason**: Document exact error and context
3. **Provide Recovery Options**: Present user with restart/resume choices
4. **Enable Stage Restart**: Allow restart from last successful stage
5. **Maintain Session Integrity**: Preserve all successful work and cost tracking

### Recovery Strategies
- **Planning Failure**: Restart with research package validation
- **Writing Failure**: Retry with modified parameters or manual guidance
- **Quality Gate Failure**: Review feedback and re-run with adjustments
- **Polish Failure**: Manual review with user guidance for complex issues
- **Audio Synthesis Failure**: Retry with optimized settings or voice model selection

## Integration with External Research Tools

### WebSearch Validation
- Real-time fact-checking during script review
- Official source verification for claims and statistics
- Expert quote validation and attribution verification
- Current development tracking for dynamic content

### Perplexity MCP Quality Assurance
- Independent fact verification during quality evaluation
- Expert consensus validation for controversial topics
- Citation verification for research claims
