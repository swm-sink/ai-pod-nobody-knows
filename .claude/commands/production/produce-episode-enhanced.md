# Produce Episode Enhanced - Research-First Production Integration

Execute the complete production pipeline for a podcast episode with full integration of enhanced research packages, freshness validation, and cross-episode awareness.

## Usage

```
/produce-episode-enhanced [episode_number] [research_source] [options]
```

## Research Source Options

### From Research-First Workflow
```
/produce-episode-enhanced 5                           # Use batch research package for Episode 5
/produce-episode-enhanced 5 --validate-freshness     # Check freshness before production
/produce-episode-enhanced 5 --update-if-stale        # Auto-update stale research before production
```

### From Traditional Workflow (Backward Compatibility)
```
/produce-episode-enhanced 5 sessions/ep_005_20250817/research/    # Traditional session path
/produce-episode-enhanced 5 legacy                               # Use legacy research format
```

### Cross-Episode Integration
```
/produce-episode-enhanced 5 --with-connections       # Include cross-episode insights in production
/produce-episode-enhanced 5 --theme-aware           # Leverage thematic connections for richer content
```

## Prerequisites Validation

The enhanced command validates multiple prerequisite types:

### Research Package Validation
- **Research Completeness**: ≥0.85 research completeness score
- **Quality Standards**: Research package meets all quality thresholds
- **Freshness Check**: Research staleness within acceptable limits
- **Production Readiness**: Green light status from research package

### Cross-Episode Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Episodes**: Validate any prerequisite episodes are production-ready
- **Thematic Consistency**: Check consistency with related episodes in production
- **Shared Source Validation**: Ensure shared sources are accessible and current

### Production Context Validation
- **Season Positioning**: Validate episode fits within season arc
- **Complexity Progression**: Ensure complexity aligns with series progression
- **Brand Consistency**: Verify alignment with intellectual humility philosophy

## Execution Strategy

Use the 01_production_orchestrator subagent with research-first enhancements:

2. **Freshness Validation**: Check research staleness and trigger updates if needed
3. **Cross-Episode Integration**: Incorporate insights from related episodes
4. **Quality Gate Validation**: Ensure research meets production quality standards

### Phase 2: Context-Aware Episode Planning
1. **Thematic Integration**: Leverage thematic analysis from research package
2. **Cross-Episode Continuity**: Ensure consistency with related episodes
3. **Brand Alignment Optimization**: Maximize intellectual humility elements
4. **Complexity Appropriateness**: Validate content complexity matches episode level

### Phase 3: Enhanced Production Pipeline
1. **Research-Informed Script Generation**: Use comprehensive research insights
2. **Cross-Episode Reference Integration**: Include relevant connections to other episodes
3. **Expert Quote Integration**: Seamlessly integrate curated expert perspectives
4. **Nobody Knows Moment Optimization**: Maximize identified uncertainty moments

### Phase 4: Quality Validation with Research Context
1. **Research-Script Alignment**: Validate script accurately reflects research insights
2. **Cross-Episode Consistency Check**: Ensure consistency with related episodes
3. **Brand Voice Validation**: Verify intellectual humility theme throughout
4. **Factual Accuracy Verification**: Cross-check facts against research sources
