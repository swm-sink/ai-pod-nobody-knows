# /research - Deep Knowledge Research

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive research to fill knowledge gaps identified during exploration or planning phases.

## When to Use
- **REQUIRED for:** Knowledge gaps, technology evaluation, best practices research
- **Forbidden without:** 5+ high-quality sources, comparative analysis
- **Quality gate:** Confidence ≥7/10, evidence-based recommendations

## Process

### 1. Research Planning
- Define specific research questions
- Identify required information types
- Set research scope and timeline
- Plan source validation strategy

### 2. Source Gathering
- Academic papers and research studies
- Official documentation and specifications
- Industry best practices and case studies
- Expert opinions and community discussions
- Performance benchmarks and comparisons

### 3. Information Analysis
- Verify source credibility and recency
- Compare conflicting information
- Identify patterns and trends
- Extract actionable insights

### 4. Synthesis
- Organize findings by relevance
- Create recommendations with evidence
- Document uncertainty and limitations
- Provide confidence assessments

## Deliverable
Create research document in `.claude/processes/research-[topic]-[date].md` containing:
- Research questions and methodology
- Annotated source list (minimum 5 sources)
- Comparative analysis of approaches
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Confidence assessment and limitations

## Educational Value
**Technical:** Develops information literacy, source evaluation skills, and evidence-based decision making essential for technical leadership.

**Simple:** Like being a scientist - you gather evidence from multiple sources before drawing conclusions, so your decisions are based on facts not guesses.

**Connection:** This teaches research methodology and critical analysis skills valuable in any professional context.

## Next Steps
- **Flows to:** `/plan` for implementation planning, `/validate` for approach verification
- **Incomplete research:** Continue until confidence ≥7/10 achieved
- **Conflicting information:** Document alternatives with pros/cons
