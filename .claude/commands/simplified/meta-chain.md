## Progress Tracking

```yaml
progress_dashboard:
  current_step: [1-13]
  completion_percentage: XX%
  time_elapsed: XX:XX
  confidence_level: X/10
  
  checklist:
    ✅ Explore
    ✅ Research
    ⏳ Plan
    ⬜ Decompose
    ⬜ Implement-TDD
    ⬜ Refactor-TDD
    ⬜ Deploy-TDD
    ⬜ Iterate
    ⬜ Assess
    ⬜ Validate
    ⬜ Commit
    ⬜ Retrospect
    ⬜ Complete
```

## Methodological Principles

```yaml
core_principles:
  systematic_approach: "Each step builds on previous"
  quality_gates: "Cannot proceed without completion"
  documentation: "Every step produces artifacts"
  validation: "Built-in quality checks"
  learning: "Continuous improvement focus"
  
execution_modes:
  full_chain: "Complete 13-step execution"
  selective: "Choose specific steps"
  iterative: "Repeat steps 5-8 as needed"
  fast_track: "Essential steps only (1,3,5,10)"
```

## Time Management

```yaml
typical_duration:
  full_methodology: "8-12 hours"
  fast_track: "3-4 hours"
  per_step_average: "45 minutes"
  
optimization_tips:
  - Parallel research activities
  - Reuse existing patterns
  - Leverage templates
  - Batch similar tasks
  - Automate validations
```

## Quality Checkpoints

```yaml
step_validation:
  explore: "Problem clearly defined?"
  research: "Knowledge comprehensive?"
  plan: "Strategy actionable?"
  decompose: "Tasks <4 hours?"
  implement: "Tests passing?"
  refactor: "Code clean?"
  deploy: "System live?"
  iterate: "Improvements measurable?"
  assess: "Goals achieved?"
  validate: "Quality confirmed?"
  commit: "Changes tracked?"
  retrospect: "Learnings captured?"
  complete: "Documentation ready?"
```

## Common Patterns

```yaml
problem_types:
  feature_development:
    emphasis: [implement, refactor, test]
    
  bug_fixing:
    emphasis: [explore, research, implement]
    
  optimization:
    emphasis: [assess, iterate, validate]
    
  architecture:
    emphasis: [research, plan, decompose]
    
  documentation:
    emphasis: [research, complete]
```

## Success Metrics

```json

  "methodology_adherence": 100,
  "steps_completed": 13,
  "quality_gates_passed": 13,
  "time_efficiency": 0.85,
  "documentation_completeness": 1.0,
  "learning_captured": true,
  "ready_for_production": true
