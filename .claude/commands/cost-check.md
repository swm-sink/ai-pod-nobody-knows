## Examples

### Basic Cost Check
```
/cost-check
```
**Result:** cost-tracker shows current episode budget status: $2.15 / $2.80 (77% utilization), remaining budget $0.65, status: HEALTHY (Episode 1 empirical validation)

### Detailed Agent Breakdown
```
/cost-check episode_2024_08_21 --detailed
```
**Result:** cost-tracker displays per-agent costs, efficiency metrics, and budget compliance:
- script-writer: $0.85 / $0.90 (94% utilization) - HIGH EFFICIENCY
- audio-synthesizer: $1.45 / $1.50 (97% utilization) - OPTIMAL (Episode 1: $1.44 actual)
- research agents: $0.35 / $0.40 (88% utilization) - EFFICIENT
- Cost leaders, budget alerts, optimization opportunities based on empirical data

### Predictive Analysis
```
/cost-check --predict
```

### Optimization Recommendations
```
/cost-check --optimize
```
**Result:** cost-tracker provides actionable recommendations based on Episode 1 lessons:
- Use direct ElevenLabs API instead of MCP (save $0.15)

## Integration with Hooks System

### Pre-Execution Cost Validation
```bash
# Hook integration for budget enforcement
pre_agent_execution() {
    local agent_id=$1
    local estimated_cost=$2

    # Use cost-tracker for validation
    if ! cost-tracker validate_budget $agent_id $estimated_cost; then
        echo "BUDGET_VIOLATION: Operation cancelled"
        return 1
    fi

    echo "BUDGET_OK: Operation approved"
}
```

### Post-Execution Cost Tracking
```bash
# Automatic cost recording after agent execution
post_agent_execution() {
    local agent_id=$1
    local actual_cost=$2

    # Record cost and update budget tracking
    cost-tracker record_cost $agent_id $actual_cost

    # Check for budget threshold alerts
    cost-tracker check_thresholds
}
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
The command integrates with hooks for:
- **Continuous tracking**: Cost accumulation after every tool use
- **Threshold monitoring**: Automatic alerts when approaching limits
- **Predictive analysis**: Updated projections based on current velocity
