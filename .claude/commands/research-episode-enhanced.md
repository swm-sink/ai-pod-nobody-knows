# /research-episode-enhanced - Native Claude Code Research Workflow

## ðŸš¨ QUALITY-OPTIMIZED WITH EMPIRICAL THRESHOLDS - Episode 1 Validated

**Date**: August 25, 2025
**Source**: Episode 1 production validation - quality threshold recalibration
**Impact**: All research quality gates aligned with achievable >85% production thresholds

Execute comprehensive research for a "Nobody Knows" podcast episode using Claude Code native orchestration patterns with empirically validated quality gates and integrated validation framework.

## Usage

```bash
/research-episode-enhanced [episode_number] [topic] [--batch-mode]
```

## Examples

```bash
/research-episode-enhanced 1 "The Dirty Secret: Even the Experts Are Making It Up"
/research-episode-enhanced 25 "Season Finale: What We've Learned About Not Knowing" --batch-mode
```

## Native Claude Code Orchestration

This command demonstrates proper Claude Code architecture where **the main chat acts as orchestrator** and **directly invokes specialized research agents**, using native orchestration patterns for optimal agent execution and tool access.

### Research Workflow Architecture

**Native Pattern (This Command)**:
```
Main Chat â†’ Direct Agent Invocation â†’ Specialized research agents
```

**Anti-Pattern (Avoided)**:
```
Main Chat â†’ Task Tool Delegation â†’ Simulated agent responses
```

## Research Pipeline Execution

I will coordinate the complete research pipeline using direct orchestrator invocation:

### Step 1: Initialize Research Session
```
Create session directory: sessions/ep_{number}_{timestamp}/research/
Set up tracking for three-agent research workflow
Initialize cost tracking and quality gates
```

### Step 2: Direct Invocation of Deep Research Agent
```
Use the research-deep-dive agent to conduct comprehensive investigation:

REQUIREMENTS:
- Multi-round Perplexity searches (10+ rounds with current date context August 2025)
- WebSearch integration for real-time source validation and expert quote verification
- Expert quotes with pronunciation validation (IPA phoneme markup for names)
- Expert authority verification and credibility assessment
- Cross-episode awareness for thematic connections and series coherence
- Save COMPLETE research data (not just metadata) with quality metrics
- Focus on intellectual humility brand alignment (>85% threshold target)
```

### Step 3: Direct Invocation of Question Generator Agent
```
Have the question-generator agent create strategic research questions:

INPUT: Deep research findings from Step 2
REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate 50+ specific research questions with empirical validation focus
- Adaptive complexity scaling based on episode complexity level
- Brand alignment with "Nobody Knows" intellectual humility philosophy (>85% consistency target)
- Cross-episode intelligence integration with production quality awareness
- Prioritize by relevance, research depth, and production feasibility
- Include pronunciation and accuracy verification questions for expert names
- Save comprehensive question framework with quality validation criteria
```

### Step 4: Direct Invocation of Research Synthesizer Agent
```
Use the research-synthesis agent to create production-ready package:

INPUT: All research findings + generated questions
REQUIREMENTS:
- Cross-domain integration and narrative coherence optimization
- Intelligent knowledge graph management for series-level insights
- Brand voice preservation throughout synthesis (>85% consistency validation)
- Production-ready knowledge package with empirical quality gates integration
- Comprehensive research package with cross-episode connections and pronunciation guides
- Quality validation using Episode 1 calibrated thresholds (>85% composite validation)
- Expert name pronunciation accuracy preparation for TTS optimization
- Research accuracy verification against empirical production requirements
```

### Step 5: Session Management & User Review
```
Coordinate session completion:
- Aggregate all agent outputs into comprehensive research package with quality validation
- Create readable summary: sessions/ep_{number}_{timestamp}/research/research_summary.md with quality metrics
- Save complete research data: sessions/ep_{number}_{timestamp}/research/research_complete.json with empirical validation
- Track costs and validate quality gates using Episode 1 calibrated thresholds
- Include pronunciation guide for all expert names and technical terms
- Prepare user review checkpoint with production readiness assessment
```
