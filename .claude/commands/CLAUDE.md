  documentation: "@.claude/commands/meta-chain.md"
```

## üîÑ EXECUTION PATTERNS

### Sequential Pipeline
```mermaid
graph LR
  Start --> Research
  Research --> Script
  Script --> Audio
  Audio --> Output
```

### Checkpoint System
```yaml
checkpoints:
  post_research:
    validate: "Source verification complete"
    cost_check: "Within research budget"
    continue_if: "Quality ‚â• threshold"
  
  post_script:
    validate: "Consensus achieved"
    user_review: "Optional quality check"
    continue_if: "Approved for audio"
  
  post_audio:
    validate: "STT accuracy ‚â•90%"
    final_check: "All quality gates passed"
    publish_if: "Complete validation"
```

### Error Recovery
```yaml
failure_handling:
  research_failure:
    action: "Retry with expanded parameters"
    max_retries: 3
    fallback: "Manual research required"
  
  script_failure:
    action: "Reduce complexity and retry"
    max_retries: 2
    fallback: "Use template structure"
  
  audio_failure:
    action: "Chunk and process segments"
    max_retries: 2
    fallback: "Alternative voice model"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è COMMAND MANAGEMENT

### Creating Commands
```markdown
# Command Template
---
name: command-name
description: "Purpose statement"
---

## Usage
/command-name [parameters]

## Execution
1. Step one
2. Step two
...
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test individual command
/research-workflow

# Test with parameters
/podcast-workflow "Test Topic"

# Dry run mode
/podcast-workflow --dry-run "Topic"
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# View command logs
tail -f .claude/logs/commands.log

# Check execution history
cat .claude/logs/command-history.json

# Performance metrics
python analyze_command_metrics.py
```

## üöÄ BEST PRACTICES

### Command Design
‚úÖ Clear, descriptive names  
‚úÖ Consistent parameter format  
‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling  
‚úÖ Progress indicators  
‚úÖ Cost warnings before expensive operations

### Workflow Optimization
‚úÖ Parallel execution where possible  
‚úÖ Early validation to fail fast  
‚úÖ Checkpoint recovery system  
‚úÖ Resource pooling for efficiency  
‚úÖ Metric collection throughout

## üîó STATE MANAGEMENT

### Session Persistence
```python
# Command creates session
session_id = state_mgr.create_episode_session(num, topic)

# Workflow updates state
state_mgr.update_phase(session_id, "research", "complete")

# State persists across commands
state_mgr.save_checkpoint(session_id, phase, data)
```

### State Recovery
```python
# Resume interrupted workflow
state_mgr.resume_episode(session_id)

# Recover from checkpoint
state_mgr.load_checkpoint(session_id, phase)

# Clean failed sessions
state_mgr.cleanup_failed_sessions()
```
