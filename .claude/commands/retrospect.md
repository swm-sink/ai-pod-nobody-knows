# /retrospect - Learning Capture and Process Improvement

## Purpose
Capture insights, lessons learned, and process improvements from completed work to enhance future performance.

## When to Use
- **REQUIRED for:** After every significant task, project, or deployment
- **Forbidden without:** Complete work cycle from exploration through deployment
- **Quality gate:** Actionable insights documented, process improvements identified

## Process

### 1. Outcome Analysis
- Compare actual results vs planned objectives
- Identify what worked well and delivered value
- Document what didn't work and why
- Measure success against original success criteria

### 2. Process Evaluation
- Review effectiveness of each methodology step
- Identify bottlenecks, delays, and inefficiencies
- Evaluate quality of decisions and their outcomes
- Assess resource utilization and timeline accuracy

### 3. Learning Extraction
- Identify key insights and "aha!" moments
- Document technical knowledge gained
- Capture problem-solving approaches that worked
- Note patterns and anti-patterns discovered

### 4. Improvement Planning
- Propose specific process improvements
- Identify tools, skills, or knowledge gaps to address
- Plan experiments to test improvement hypotheses
- Set learning goals for future work cycles

## Deliverable
Create retrospective report in `.claude/processes/retrospective-[project]-[date].md` containing:
- Outcome analysis with quantitative metrics
- Process evaluation with specific recommendations
- Learning catalog with transferable insights
- Improvement action plan with success measures

## Educational Value
**Technical:** Develops continuous improvement mindset, systematic learning practices, and reflective analysis skills essential for professional growth and team effectiveness.

**Simple:** Like keeping a journal after important experiences - you write down what you learned, what you'd do differently, and how to be better next time.

**Connection:** This teaches reflection, learning, and improvement skills that accelerate growth in any field by turning every experience into valuable knowledge.

## Next Steps
- **Flows to:** Next work cycle with improved processes and knowledge
- **Action items identified:** Schedule implementation of improvements
- **Knowledge gaps found:** Plan learning activities to address them
