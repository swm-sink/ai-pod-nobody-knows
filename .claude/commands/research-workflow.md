# /research-workflow - 2024-2025 Interactive Research Pipeline

Execute comprehensive research using modernized agent orchestration with interactive strategy confirmation, explicit reasoning transparency, and comprehensive quality validation for current, verified information with zero training data reliance.

## Usage

```bash
/research-workflow [episode_topic]
```

## Example

```bash
/research-workflow "The Dirty Secret: Even the Experts Are Making It Up"
```

## Purpose

**Technical:** Advanced research orchestration implementing 2024-2025 prompt engineering patterns for zero-training-data investigation with interactive agent coordination, explicit reasoning transparency, user confirmation loops, and comprehensive source validation.

**Simple:** Like having a team of expert researchers who talk you through their research strategy, ask for your approval on their approach, and explain their findings with complete transparency about what they know and don't know.

**Connection:** This teaches research methodology, interactive AI collaboration, and systematic knowledge validation with intellectual humility integration.
