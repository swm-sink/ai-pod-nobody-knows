  <what-is-openrouter>
    <technical-explanation>
      OpenRouter functions as a unified AI model gateway implementing transparent proxy patterns
      with intelligent routing algorithms. It abstracts provider-specific implementations behind
      a standardized OpenAI-compatible interface, enabling seamless multi-provider orchestration.
    </technical-explanation>
    <simple-explanation>
      Think of OpenRouter like a universal remote control for AI models. Instead of needing
      separate controllers (APIs) for each AI service, you get one remote that works with
      400+ different AI models from all the major companies.

      <technical-explanation>
        Transparent failover mechanisms maintain service availability through intelligent
        model matching and automatic routing to backup providers without code modifications.
      </technical-explanation>
      <simple-explanation>
        If your primary AI model goes down or gets overloaded, OpenRouter automatically
        switches to a backup model that works similarly, so your production never stops.
