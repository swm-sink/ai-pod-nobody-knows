## Phase 1: Comprehensive Feedback Analysis and Categorization (8 minutes)

### Feedback Type Classification System
**Technical:** Advanced feedback categorization enables targeted revision strategies for optimal efficiency
**Simple:** Like sorting mail into different boxes - each type gets handled by the right process

#### Type 1: Comprehension Feedback
**Indicators:** "confusing," "unclear," "too complex," "jargon," "hard to follow"
**Processing Strategy:**
```python
def process_comprehension_feedback(feedback_items):
    for item in comprehension_issues:
        - Apply Feynman simplification protocols
        - Generate appropriate analogies
        - Restructure for clarity
        - Add progressive complexity building
        - Implement stepped explanations
```

#### Type 2: Brand Consistency Feedback
**Indicators:** "overconfident," "missing humility," "needs questions," "too certain"
**Processing Strategy:**
```python
def process_brand_feedback(feedback_items):
    for item in brand_issues:
        - Apply humility detector algorithms
        - Inject curiosity markers
        - Add epistemic uncertainty phrases
        - Enhance intellectual honesty
        - Balance confidence with humility
```

#### Type 3: Engagement Feedback
**Indicators:** "boring," "low energy," "poor flow," "loses interest," "weak transitions"
**Processing Strategy:**
```python
def process_engagement_feedback(feedback_items):
    for item in engagement_issues:
        - Optimize narrative flow
        - Strengthen hooks and momentum
        - Add compelling questions
        - Enhance energy modulation
        - Improve transition smoothness
```

#### Type 4: Technical Accuracy Feedback
**Indicators:** "factual error," "inaccurate," "wrong information," "needs verification"
**Processing Strategy:**
```python
def process_accuracy_feedback(feedback_items):
    for item in accuracy_issues:
        - Implement fact verification workflows
        - Add appropriate source citations
        - Enhance precision and specificity
        - Correct technical terminology
        - Validate scientific claims
```

### Feedback Prioritization Matrix
```yaml
Priority_1_CRITICAL: [factual_errors, comprehension_blockers, major_brand_violations]
Priority_2_HIGH: [engagement_issues, moderate_brand_gaps, clarity_problems]
Priority_3_MEDIUM: [flow_optimization, minor_inconsistencies, style_refinements]
Priority_4_LOW: [word_choice_improvements, micro_adjustments, polish_touches]
```

## Phase 2: Brand Voice Enhancement Algorithms (12 minutes)

### Algorithm 1: Humility Detector and Enhancement
**Technical:** Pattern recognition system for overconfident statements with automatic softening protocols
**Simple:** Like having a friend who catches you when you sound too sure about uncertain things

```python
class HumilityDetector:
    def scan_overconfidence_patterns(self, script):
        overconfident_markers = [
            "This is definitely...", "We know for certain...",
            "It's obvious that...", "Clearly, the answer is...",
            "Scientists have proven...", "The data shows definitively..."
        ]
        return self.identify_and_flag(overconfident_markers)

    def apply_softening_protocols(self, flagged_statements):
        softening_techniques = {
            "certainty_reduction": ["likely", "appears to", "suggests", "indicates"],
            "expert_uncertainty": ["experts believe", "current understanding", "emerging evidence"],
            "humility_injection": ["we're still learning", "the picture is complex", "nobody fully understands"]
        }
        return self.transform_statements(flagged_statements, softening_techniques)
```

### Algorithm 2: Curiosity Injection Engine
**Technical:** Advanced question generation and wonder expression system for enhanced engagement
**Simple:** Like adding "what if" and "imagine" moments that make people want to learn more

```python
class CuriosityInjector:
    def identify_injection_points(self, script):
        optimal_locations = [
            "after_complex_concepts", "before_major_transitions",
            "following_surprising_facts", "preceding_explanations"
        ]
        return self.map_insertion_opportunities(optimal_locations)

    def generate_curiosity_markers(self, context):
        curiosity_patterns = {
            "wonder_questions": ["But here's what's fascinating...", "This makes you wonder..."],
            "exploration_hooks": ["The really interesting question is...", "What we don't yet understand..."],
            "mystery_elements": ["Here's the puzzling part...", "Scientists are still debating..."],
            "future_thinking": ["Imagine if we could...", "What might happen if..."]
        }
        return self.select_appropriate_pattern(context, curiosity_patterns)
```

### Algorithm 3: Analogy Optimization System
**Technical:** Complex concept simplification through everyday comparison generation and validation
**Simple:** Like having a translator who turns complicated ideas into familiar stories everyone understands

```python
class AnalogyOptimizer:
    def identify_complex_concepts(self, script):
        complexity_indicators = [
            "technical_terminology", "abstract_concepts", "multi_step_processes",
            "mathematical_relationships", "scientific_phenomena"
        ]
        return self.flag_simplification_candidates(complexity_indicators)

    def generate_appropriate_analogies(self, concept):
        analogy_frameworks = {
            "everyday_objects": ["like a kitchen appliance", "think of your smartphone"],
            "familiar_processes": ["like learning to ride a bike", "similar to cooking dinner"],
            "human_experiences": ["imagine meeting a new person", "like planning a vacation"],
            "nature_examples": ["like how trees grow", "similar to weather patterns"]
        }
        return self.match_concept_to_framework(concept, analogy_frameworks)

    def validate_analogy_effectiveness(self, original_concept, proposed_analogy):
        effectiveness_criteria = [
            "accuracy_maintained", "simplification_achieved",
            "relatability_high", "memorability_enhanced"
        ]
        return self.score_analogy(proposed_analogy, effectiveness_criteria)
```

## Advanced Error Handling and Recovery Protocols

### Error Classification System
```python
class RevisionErrorHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.error_categories = {
            'input_errors': ['missing_feedback', 'invalid_script', 'corrupted_data'],
            'processing_errors': ['algorithm_failures', 'timeout_exceeded', 'memory_overflow'],
            'quality_errors': ['threshold_failures', 'regression_detected', 'inconsistency_introduced'],
            'output_errors': ['formatting_broken', 'validation_failed', 'export_corrupted']
        }

    def handle_error(self, error_type, error_details, current_state):
        recovery_strategies = {
            'input_errors': self.request_input_correction,
            'processing_errors': self.implement_fallback_algorithm,
            'quality_errors': self.trigger_additional_pass,
            'output_errors': self.regenerate_output_section
        }
        return recovery_strategies[error_type](error_details, current_state)

    def implement_rollback(self, checkpoint_state):
        """Restore to last known good state if recovery fails"""
        return self.restore_revision_state(checkpoint_state)
```

### Fallback Strategies
- **Algorithm Failure:** Revert to manual editing approach with simplified techniques
- **Quality Gate Failure:** Implement focused revision on failed metrics only
- **Time Overrun:** Switch to critical-fixes-only mode with abbreviated passes
- **Conflicting Requirements:** Escalate to human decision maker with analysis
- **Technical Errors:** Preserve work state and provide detailed error report
