## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Validation

#### Step 1: Agent Registration
```bash
# Verify agent specification is in correct location
ls -la .claude/level-2-production/agents/script-writer.md

# Validate agent syntax and completeness
# (Manual review of agent specification)
```

#### Step 2: Directory Structure Preparation
```bash
# Create required output directories
mkdir -p .claude/level-2-production/output/test-episode/script/
mkdir -p .claude/level-2-production/backup/scripts/

# Set appropriate permissions
chmod 755 .claude/level-2-production/output/
chmod 755 .claude/level-2-production/backup/
```

#### Step 3: Integration Testing
```yaml
integration_tests:
  input_processing:
    test: "Can agent parse existing research packages?"
    validation: "Use consciousness-hard-problem-research-package.md"
    success_criteria: "Correctly identifies all knowledge layers"
    
  output_generation:
    test: "Does agent produce properly formatted scripts?"
    validation: "Generate sample script and validate structure"
    success_criteria: "All required sections present with audio notation"
    
  quality_gates:
    test: "Are quality metrics properly calculated?"
    validation: "Run automated quality assessment"
    success_criteria: "All metrics calculated within expected ranges"
```

### Phase 2: Limited Testing

#### Step 4: Controlled Environment Testing
```yaml
test_configuration:
  scope: "Single test episode with known research package"
  monitoring: "Full logging and quality tracking enabled"
  validation: "Human review of all outputs"
  fallback: "Manual script writing available as backup"
  
  success_criteria:
    word_count: "3900-4100 words achieved"
    quality_gates: "≥85% overall score"
    brand_consistency: "≥0.90 score"
    cost_efficiency: "Within $2.50 budget"
    generation_time: "≤20 minutes"
```

**Test Execution Command**:
```
@script-writer "Transform research package: consciousness-hard-problem-research-package.md into podcast script for test deployment"
```

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Script generates without errors
- [ ] All quality gates assessed
- [ ] Audio notation properly formatted  
- [ ] Brand voice compliance verified
- [ ] Cost tracking accurate
- [ ] Integration with session management working

#### Step 5: Quality Assurance Review
```yaml
qa_review_process:
  automated_checks:
    - quality_metrics_validation
    - structure_compliance_check
    - brand_voice_assessment
    - audio_readiness_verification
    
  human_review:
    - narrative_flow_evaluation
    - intellectual_humility_assessment
    - accessibility_without_oversimplification
    - audio_director_delivery_review
    
  approval_criteria:
    automated_pass_rate: ≥90
    human_review_score: ≥8.0/10
    brand_alignment: ≥0.90
    ready_for_phase_3: true
```

### Phase 3: Parallel Operation

#### Step 6: Dual-Track Production
```yaml
parallel_operation:
  approach: "Run script-writer alongside manual process"
  comparison_metrics:
    - quality_scores_comparison
    - time_efficiency_analysis  
    - cost_effectiveness_evaluation
    - brand_consistency_measurement
    
  duration: "2-3 episodes"
  evaluation_criteria:
    quality_parity: "Script-writer scores ≥95% of manual quality"
    efficiency_gains: "Time reduction ≥30%"
    cost_effectiveness: "Cost per quality point improved"
```

#### Step 7: Performance Optimization
Based on parallel operation results, optimize:
- Prompt efficiency for cost reduction
- Quality gate calibration for accuracy
- Brand voice pattern recognition
- Audio notation completeness

### Phase 4: Full Deployment

#### Step 8: Production Integration
```yaml
full_deployment:
  scope: "Primary script generation for all new episodes"
  monitoring: "Continuous quality and performance tracking"
  human_oversight: "Quality assurance review for first 5 episodes"
  
  success_metrics:
    quality_maintenance: "All episodes meet ≥0.85 overall score"
    cost_efficiency: "Budget adherence 95%"
    time_performance: "Generation within 20-minute limit"
    brand_consistency: "≥0.90 brand score maintained"
```

#### Step 9: Workflow Integration
