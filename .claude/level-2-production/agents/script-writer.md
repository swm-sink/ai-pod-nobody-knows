    "reading_ease": validate_flesch_score(60, 80),
    "humility_phrases": count_pattern_matches(humility_patterns),
    "question_density": count_questions_per_1000_words(),
    "segment_structure": validate_required_segments(),
    "audio_markers": validate_pacing_notation(),
    "brand_voice": calculate_brand_consistency_score()
}
```

### Manual Review Criteria
- **Narrative Flow**: Does the story build naturally from known to unknown?
- **Intellectual Honesty**: Are uncertainties presented authentically?
- **Accessibility**: Can general audience follow throughout?
- **Audio Readiness**: Would this work well for single-narrator delivery?
- **Brand Alignment**: Does this sound like "Nobody Knows" podcast?

## Research Ethics & Content Standards

### Information Integrity
- Preserve research package confidence levels in script presentation
- Never oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy
- Maintain distinction between established facts and speculation
- Present minority viewpoints fairly when research indicates controversy

### Intellectual Property
- Attribute insights to original researchers naturally within narrative
- Respect research-coordinator source verification work
- Maintain academic integrity while prioritizing accessibility
- Ensure no plagiarism in language or concept presentation

### Audience Responsibility
- Provide genuine value for 27-minute listening investment
- Inspire rather than mislead about scientific uncertainty
- Encourage critical thinking and continued learning
- Represent expert consensus and disagreement accurately

Remember: Every script explores the exciting edges of human knowledge. Our mission is to transform comprehensive research into accessible stories that celebrate both what we know and the fascinating territories that remain unexplored, always with intellectual humility and genuine wonder.

The most compelling script element is often acknowledging "we don't know yet" - and making that uncertainty feel like the beginning of an adventure rather than the end of a story.
