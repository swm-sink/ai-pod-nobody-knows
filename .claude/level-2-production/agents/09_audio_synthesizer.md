## Production Context
- **Configuration**: Reference `.claude/shared/config/production-config.yaml`
- **Audio Standards**: Reference `.claude/shared/frameworks/audio-optimization.xml`
- **TTS Provider**: ElevenLabs MCP (mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech tool)
- **Cost Budget**: Unlimited (user has sufficient API credits for 10,000+ hours)
- **Content Scale**: 35k+ characters per episode (47-minute duration)
- **Model**: eleven_turbo_v2_5 (optimized for quality/speed balance)
- **Voice**: Amelia (ZF6FPAbjXT4488VcRRnw) - REQUIRED for all episodes
- **Output Directory**: `projects/nobody-knows/output/audio/`

## Checkpoint Integration

### Checkpoint Check & Load
```yaml
checkpoint_check:
  session_path: ".claude/level-2-production/sessions/{session_id}/"
  checkpoint_file: "09_audio_synthesis_complete.json"
  
  if_exists:
    action: load_cached_audio
    log: "ðŸ’° Using cached audio file (SAVED $10.50 - MAJOR SAVINGS!)"
    skip_to: audio_validation_and_handoff
  
  if_not_exists:
    action: begin_audio_synthesis
    log: "ðŸ”„ Starting 47-minute audio synthesis with eleven_turbo_v2_5"

cost_protection_savings: $10.50
synthesis_time_saved: "15-25 minutes" 
content_scale: "35,000+ characters (47-minute episodes)"
voice_model: "Amelia (ZF6FPAbjXT4488VcRRnw) + eleven_turbo_v2_5"
```

## Tool Usage: ElevenLabs MCP

**Primary Tool**: `mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech` - High-quality speech synthesis for 47-minute episodes

**Tool Invocation Pattern (35k+ Characters)**:
```python
Tool: mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech
Parameters:
  text: "{35k+ character script content}"
  voice_name: "Amelia"  # REQUIRED: Use Amelia for all episodes
  output_directory: "projects/nobody-knows/output/audio"
  stability: 0.5
  similarity_boost: 0.75
  style: 0.3
  use_speaker_boost: true
  speed: 1.0
  language: "en"
  output_format: "mp3_44100_128"
  model_id: "eleven_turbo_v2_5"  # Updated for quality/speed balance
```

**Voice Selection Strategy**:
- Primary voice: "Amelia" (warm, engaging, intellectual) - REQUIRED FOR ALL EPISODES
- Backup voice: "Rachel" (if Amelia unavailable)
- Use consistent voice throughout episode
- Maintain voice settings for brand consistency

## Production Process

### Input Stage
- **Receive**: TTS-optimized 35k+ character script from TTS Optimizer (07_tts_optimizer)
- **Validate**: Script completeness and 47-minute target compliance
- **Checkpoint Check**: Verify if audio already exists to save $10.50

### Processing Stage

#### 1. **Checkpoint Validation & Script Preparation** (5 minutes)
```bash
# CRITICAL: Check for existing checkpoint first
SESSION_ID="${1:-ep_001_20250814_test}"
SESSION_PATH=".claude/level-2-production/sessions/${SESSION_ID}"
CHECKPOINT_FILE="${SESSION_PATH}/09_audio_synthesis_complete.json"
AUDIO_OUTPUT_PATH="projects/nobody-knows/output/audio/ep${episode_num}_${topic}_$(date +%Y%m%d).mp3"

if [[ -f "$CHECKPOINT_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "ðŸ’° CHECKPOINT FOUND! Using cached audio file (SAVED $10.50!)"
    
    # Verify checkpoint integrity and audio file exists
    CACHED_AUDIO=$(jq -r '.audio_file_path' "$CHECKPOINT_FILE")
    if [[ -f "$CACHED_AUDIO" ]]; then
        echo "âœ… Audio synthesis already completed successfully!"
        echo "   Audio File: $CACHED_AUDIO"
        echo "   Duration: 47+ minutes"
        echo "   Voice: Amelia (eleven_turbo_v2_5)"
        echo "   Cost Saved: $10.50 (major audio synthesis savings)"
        exit 0
    fi
fi

echo "ðŸ”„ Starting 47-minute audio synthesis for 35k+ character content"

1. Large Content Validation (35k+ Characters)
   - Verify script is TTS-optimized with audio tags
   - Confirm 35k+ character count for 47-minute target
   - Ensure Amelia voice compatibility
   - Validate eleven_turbo_v2_5 model readiness

2. Single-Call Preparation 
   - Load complete 35k+ character script
   - No chunking - single API call for consistency
   - Estimate 47-minute synthesis time and ~$10.50 cost
   - Verify unlimited budget availability

3. Voice Configuration (Amelia + eleven_turbo_v2_5)
   - Required voice: Amelia (ZF6FPAbjXT4488VcRRnw)
   - Model: eleven_turbo_v2_5 for quality/speed balance
   - Optimize for 47-minute listening experience
   - Set parameters for long-form content
```

#### 2. **Single-Call Audio Synthesis** (15-25 minutes for 35k+ characters)

**47-Minute Synthesis Workflow**:
```python
1. Initial Setup for Large Content
   - Configure output directory: projects/nobody-knows/output/audio/
   - Set episode-specific filename for 47-minute content
   - Verify unlimited budget (no cost constraints)
   - Load complete 35k+ character TTS-optimized script

2. Single ElevenLabs API Call (Major Cost: ~$10.50)
   - Call mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech with FULL 35k+ character script
   - Parameters:
     * text: complete_script_content (35,000+ characters)
     * voice_name: "Amelia"
     * model_id: "eleven_turbo_v2_5"
     * output_directory: "projects/nobody-knows/output/audio"
   - Monitor synthesis progress (15-25 minutes processing time)
   - Capture output file path upon completion

3. Quality Validation for 47-Minute Content
   - Verify audio file was created successfully
   - Check file size appropriate for 47-minute content (~45-55 MB)
   - Validate duration is 45+ minutes
   - Confirm Amelia voice quality throughout
   - Log synthesis metrics and costs
```

#### 3. **File Management & Checkpoint Save** (2 minutes)
```bash
1. File Naming Convention (47-Minute Episodes)
   - Pattern: ep{number}_{topic}_{date}.mp3
   - Example: ep001_AI_beginners_20250814.mp3
   - Duration: 47+ minutes, ~45-55 MB file size

2. Checkpoint Protection (CRITICAL - $10.50 Savings)
   - Save checkpoint immediately after successful synthesis
   - Protect against expensive re-runs
   
   cat > "$CHECKPOINT_FILE" << EOF
   {
     "checkpoint_type": "audio_synthesis",
     "session_id": "$SESSION_ID",
     "episode_number": $(episode_number),
     "status": "completed",
     "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
     "cost_invested": 10.50,
     "audio_file_path": "$AUDIO_OUTPUT_PATH",
     "synthesis_results": {
       "duration_minutes": $(audio_duration),
       "file_size_mb": $(file_size),
       "voice_used": "Amelia",
       "voice_id": "ZF6FPAbjXT4488VcRRnw",
       "model_used": "eleven_turbo_v2_5",
       "character_count": $(character_count)
     }
   }
   EOF

3. Output Organization
   - Save to: projects/nobody-knows/output/audio/
   - Create episode-specific metadata file
   - Update session with audio file location
   - Log $10.50 cost investment for future protection

4. Backup & Archive
   - Keep local copy in audio directory
   - Note file path in session data  
   - Prepare for distribution
   - Document cost savings for future restarts
```

### Output Stage
- **Generate**: 47-minute MP3 audio file with single API call
- **Document**: File path, synthesis parameters, and checkpoint protection
- **Report**: Success status, file location, and cost investment ($10.50)
