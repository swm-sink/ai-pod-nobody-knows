## Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Agent Registration
```bash
# Register agent with Level 2 production system
claude-production register-agent \
  --name="research-coordinator" \
  --file="research-coordinator.md" \
  --stage="research" \
  --model="sonnet" \
  --cost-limit=3.00 \
  --quality-gates="source-verification,brand-voice,unknown-identification"
```

### Step 2: Session Template Updates
Update episode session template to include research-coordinator references:

```json
{
  "production_pipeline": {
    "stages": {
      "research": {
        "agent": "research-coordinator",
        "quality_gates": {
          "sources_minimum": { "target": 5, "actual": null, "passed": null },
          "credibility_check": { "target": true, "actual": null, "passed": null },
          "unknown_identified": { "target": true, "actual": null, "passed": null },
          "brand_voice_score": { "target": 0.90, "actual": null, "passed": null }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Quality Gate Integration
```bash
# Install quality gate validators
claude-production install-quality-gates \
  --agent="research-coordinator" \
  --gates="source-verification,brand-voice-compliance,unknown-identification" \
  --enforcement="blocking"
```

### Step 4: Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Setup production monitoring
claude-production setup-monitoring \
  --agent="research-coordinator" \
  --metrics="quality,cost,time,brand-alignment" \
  --alerts="budget-threshold,quality-failure,time-overrun" \
  --dashboard="level-2-research-coordinator"
```

### Step 5: Integration Testing in Production Environment
```bash
# Run integration test with actual episode session
claude-production test-integration \
  --agent="research-coordinator" \
  --session-template="episode-session-template.json" \
  --test-topic="The Mystery of Fast Radio Bursts" \
  --validate-handoff="script-writer"
```

## Production Operating Procedures

### Standard Operating Workflow

1. **Episode Session Initialization**
   ```bash
   claude-session create episode \
     --topic="[Research Topic]" \
     --target-duration=27 \
     --quality-target=0.85 \
     --cost-budget=9.00
   ```

2. **Research Coordinator Invocation**
   ```bash
   claude-agent invoke research-coordinator \
     --session-id="ep_XXX_YYYYMMDD_HHMM" \
     --topic="[Specific Topic]" \
     --complexity="[standard|complex]" \
     --priority="[standard|high]"
   ```

3. **Quality Gate Validation**
   - Automated quality gates run during execution
   - Human review triggered on quality gate failures
   - Session blocked until all quality gates pass

4. **Handoff to Script Writer**
   - Research package generated and validated
   - Session state updated with research outputs
   - Script-writer agent automatically invoked

### Monitoring & Alerting

#### Real-Time Alerts
- **Budget Alert**: Triggered at 80% of cost limit
- **Quality Failure**: Any quality gate failure
- **Time Overrun**: Research exceeding 35 minutes
- **Integration Error**: Session state or handoff failures

#### Daily Monitoring
- Research package quality scores
- Cost efficiency trends
- Time performance analysis
- Brand voice consistency metrics

#### Weekly Reporting
- Agent performance summary
- Quality improvement recommendations
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Integration health assessment

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Research package fails source credibility check
- **Diagnosis**: Check source tier distribution
- **Solution**: Expand search to include more authoritative sources
- **Prevention**: Implement source diversity monitoring

**Issue**: Brand voice compliance failure
- **Diagnosis**: Review intellectual humility indicators
- **Solution**: Add uncertainty acknowledgments and knowledge gap identification
- **Prevention**: Enhance brand voice checking during research process

**Issue**: Cost overrun approaching limit
