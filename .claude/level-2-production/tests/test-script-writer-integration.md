# Test: Script-Writer Integration with Feynman-Fridman Style

## Test Objective
Validate that script-writer agent correctly:
1. References centralized configurations
2. Implements Feynman-Fridman style fusion
3. Uses triple-layer analogy system
4. Meets intellectual humility metrics
5. Outputs to correct directory

## Test Checklist

### Configuration References ✓
- [ ] References `.claude/shared/brand/brand-voice-guide.md`
- [ ] References `projects/nobody-knows/config/quality_gates.json`
- [ ] References `.claude/shared/config/production-config.yaml`
- [ ] References `.claude/shared/prompts/master-podcast-prompt.md`

### Style Implementation ✓
- [ ] Feynman clarity (60% - brilliant analogies)
- [ ] Fridman curiosity (40% - technical exploration)
- [ ] Progressive complexity management
- [ ] Self-critique protocol included

### Analogy System ✓
- [ ] Universal layer (household/everyday)
- [ ] Professional layer (work processes)
- [ ] Historical layer (past innovations)

### Brand Voice Metrics ✓
- [ ] 5 intellectual humility phrases per 1000 words
- [ ] 4 genuine questions per 1000 words
- [ ] Uncertainty celebrated as exciting
- [ ] Multiple perspectives fairly presented

### Output Configuration ✓
- [ ] Scripts saved to `projects/nobody-knows/output/scripts/`
- [ ] Naming follows pattern: `ep{number}_script_{topic}_{date}.md`
- [ ] No outputs in `.claude` directory

## Test Execution

1. Load consciousness research from: `projects/nobody-knows/output/research/consciousness-hard-problem-research-package.md`
2. Generate script using updated script-writer agent
3. Verify all checklist items
4. Measure quality metrics

## Expected Results
- Script demonstrates clear Feynman-Fridman fusion
- Triple-layer analogies for major concepts
- Meets all brand voice metrics
- Outputs to correct location
- References central configurations
