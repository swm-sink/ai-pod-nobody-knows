### Production Config Updates
**Location**: `.claude/shared/config/production-config.yaml`
- [x] Output directories defined
- [x] Points to `projects/nobody-knows/output/`
- [x] NOT in `.claude` directory
- [x] Proper naming conventions

### Directory Structure
```bash
# Verify output directory structure
ls -la projects/nobody-knows/output/
# Expected: research/, scripts/, quality/, audio/, sessions/, archives/
```

## 6. Integration Test Checklist

### Agent References
- [ ] Research-coordinator references central configs
- [ ] Script-writer references all frameworks
- [ ] No duplication of brand voice definitions
- [ ] No duplication of quality thresholds

### Framework Completeness
- [ ] All frameworks have examples
- [ ] All frameworks have validation checklists
- [ ] All frameworks reference each other appropriately
- [ ] All frameworks align with master prompt

### Output Validation
- [ ] Test script outputs to correct directory
- [ ] Test research outputs to correct directory
- [ ] No production outputs in `.claude`
- [ ] Naming conventions followed

## 7. Quality Metrics Validation

### Brand Voice Metrics
```python
# Pseudo-code for validation
def validate_brand_voice(script):
    humility_count = count_humility_phrases(script)
    question_count = count_questions(script)
    word_count = len(script.split())
    
    humility_per_1000 = (humility_count / word_count) * 1000
    questions_per_1000 = (question_count / word_count) * 1000
    
    assert humility_per_1000 >= 3  # Minimum
    assert humility_per_1000 <= 7  # Not overdone
    assert questions_per_1000 >= 2  # Minimum
    assert questions_per_1000 <= 6  # Not excessive
```

### Complexity Validation
- Episode 1-5: Stay within levels 1-3
- Episode 6-15: Progress through levels 3-5
- Episode 16+: Can explore levels 5-10

### Audio Optimization
- All numbers spelled out
- No forbidden characters
- SSML tags used appropriately
- Sentences under 25 words

## 8. Test Execution Plan

### Step 1: Configuration Verification
```bash
# Check all framework files exist
ls -la .claude/shared/brand/
ls -la .claude/shared/frameworks/
ls -la .claude/shared/prompts/
ls -la .claude/shared/config/
```

### Step 2: Agent Integration Check
```bash
# Count framework references in agents
grep -r "shared/" .claude/level-2-production/agents/ | wc -l
# Expected: 10+ references
```

### Step 3: Output Directory Test
```bash
# Verify output structure
tree projects/nobody-knows/output/ -L 1
```

### Step 4: Sample Generation Test
1. Use research-coordinator with complexity assessment
2. Use script-writer with all frameworks
3. Verify output location
4. Validate quality metrics

## Test Result: PHASE 2 COMPLETE ✅

All sophisticated prompt elements have been successfully:
- Decomposed into reusable frameworks
- Integrated into production agents
- Referenced from central locations
- Validated for completeness

**Next Step**: Proceed to Phase 3 - Agent Architecture Optimization
