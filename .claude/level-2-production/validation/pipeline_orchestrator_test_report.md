â­• Script Writer: Pending (Cost: $1.50)
â­• TTS Optimizer: Pending (Cost: $2.25)
â­• Audio Synthesizer: Pending (Cost: $10.50)

Completed Stages: 0/7
ðŸ’° Total Savings: $0
ðŸ’¸ Remaining Cost: $34.50
ðŸ’­ Protection Level: NO PROTECTION (Full pipeline needed)

ðŸš€ NEXT STEP: Deep Research Agent
```

**Validation:** âœ… PERFECT
- Correctly identified no existing checkpoints

- Created new session directory automatically

### Test 3: Error Handling âœ…

**Checkpoint Integrity:** Validates JSON syntax with jq
**Missing Files:** Handles non-existent checkpoint files gracefully
**Corrupted Data:** Identifies and reports invalid checkpoint status
**Session Management:** Creates directories as needed

## Production Features

### Command Line Interface âœ…
```bash
# Usage
./pipeline-orchestrator-simple.sh <session_id> [topic]

# Examples
./pipeline-orchestrator-simple.sh ep_001_20250814_test "AI for Beginners"
./pipeline-orchestrator-simple.sh ep_002_20250814_new "Machine Learning Fundamentals"
```

### Output Features âœ…
- **Color-coded status indicators** (Green=Complete, Yellow=Pending, Red=Error)
- **Cost analysis with savings calculations** 
- **Next-step instructions** with agent file references
- **Session metadata generation** for tracking
- **Progress percentage** and completion metrics

### Integration Points âœ…
- **Checkpoint files:** Reads existing checkpoint JSON files
- **Session directories:** Creates and manages session folder structure
- **Agent coordination:** Provides specific agent execution instructions
- **Cost tracking:** Generates pipeline status reports

## Cost Protection Validation

### Checkpoint Cost Mapping âœ…
| Agent | Checkpoint File | Cost Protected |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Deep Research | 01_deep_research_complete.json | $7.50 |
| Question Generator | 02_questions_complete.json | $0.50 |
| Research Synthesizer | 03_synthesis_complete.json | $12.00 |
| Episode Planner | 04_planning_complete.json | $0.25 |
| Script Writer | 05_script_complete.json | $1.50 |
| TTS Optimizer | 07_tts_optimization_complete.json | $2.25 |
| Audio Synthesizer | 09_audio_synthesis_complete.json | $10.50 |
| **TOTAL** | **7 checkpoints** | **$34.50** |

### Protection Levels âœ…
- **$21.75 savings** = 63% cost reduction (MAJOR SAVINGS)
- **$12.00+ savings** = Research synthesis protection threshold
- **$7.50+ savings** = Deep research protection threshold
- **$0+ savings** = Partial protection from any completed work

2. **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of missing/corrupted files
3. **Cost Accuracy:** Mathematical verification of all cost calculations
4. **Session Management:** Proper directory creation and status tracking

### User Experience âœ…
1. **Clear Instructions:** Specific next-step guidance
2. **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded status for quick assessment
3. **Progress Tracking:** Completion percentages and stage counts

## Production Readiness Assessment

### âœ… TASK 13 COMPLETE: Pipeline Orchestrator with Smart Restart Detection

**Summary:**
- **Created:** Fully functional pipeline orchestrator with checkpoint awareness
- **Tested:** Both existing session (5/7 complete) and new session (0/7 complete) scenarios
- **Validated:** Cost calculations, checkpoint detection, and restart logic
- **Verified:** Error handling, session management, and user interface
