# Script Polisher Mock Feedback Testing Scenarios

## Test Suite 1: Feedback-Type-Specific Processing Validation

### Mock Scenario A: Comprehension Issues (Type 1)

**Input Script:**
```
The transformer architecture utilizes self-attention mechanisms to enable parallel processing of sequential data through matrix multiplications in high-dimensional vector spaces. The attention weights are computed via scaled dot-product operations between query, key, and value matrices, allowing the model to selectively focus on relevant input positions while maintaining computational efficiency through parallelizable operations.
```

**Mock Feedback Package:**
```json
{
  "feedback_type": "comprehension",
  "priority": "high",
  "issues": [
    {
      "line_reference": "1-5",
      "problem": "This section is too technical and confusing for our audience. Needs significant simplification.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "expected_action": "feynman_simplification"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Processing Response:**
- Feynman simplification protocols activate ✓
- Technical jargon replaced with analogies ✓
- Complex concepts broken into digestible steps ✓
- Audience-appropriate language implemented ✓

### Mock Scenario B: Brand Consistency Issues (Type 2)

**Input Script:**
```
AI will definitely revolutionize everything. We know exactly how neural networks work and can predict their behavior perfectly. The science is settled - machine learning algorithms always produce optimal results when properly configured. Scientists have proven that artificial intelligence will solve all human problems within the next decade.
```

**Mock Feedback Package:**
```json
{
  "feedback_type": "brand_consistency",
  "priority": "critical",
  "issues": [
    {
      "line_reference": "1-4",
      "problem": "This sounds too confident and certain, not matching our intellectual humility brand. Overconfident statements contradict 'Nobody Knows' philosophy.",
      "severity": "major",
      "expected_action": "humility_injection"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Processing Response:**
- Humility Detector activates and identifies overconfident patterns ✓
- Softening protocols applied ("likely", "appears to", "suggests") ✓
- Curiosity injection adds questions and wonder elements ✓
- Epistemic uncertainty markers added ✓

### Mock Scenario C: Engagement Issues (Type 3)

**Input Script:**
```
Machine learning algorithms process data. They use mathematical functions. The output is generated through computation. Neural networks have layers. Each layer performs calculations. The final layer produces results.
```

**Mock Feedback Package:**
```json
{
  "feedback_type": "engagement",
  "priority": "high",
  "issues": [
    {
      "line_reference": "1-6",
      "problem": "This is boring and choppy. Needs better flow and audience engagement. Sentences are too short and disconnected.",
      "severity": "major",
      "expected_action": "flow_optimization"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Processing Response:**
- Narrative flow optimization with smooth transitions ✓
- Energy modulation for dynamic pacing ✓
- Hook strengthening and question integration ✓
- Sentence variety and connection improvement ✓

### Mock Scenario D: Technical Accuracy Issues (Type 4)

**Input Script:**
```
GPT-4 has 175 billion parameters and was released in 2023 by OpenAI using unsupervised learning exclusively. The model was trained on internet data from 2021 and uses only transformer architecture without any other components.
```

**Mock Feedback Package:**
```json
{
  "feedback_type": "technical_accuracy",
  "priority": "critical",
  "issues": [
    {
      "line_reference": "1-2",
      "problem": "Contains multiple factual errors: GPT-4 parameter count unknown, training methodology mixed supervised/unsupervised, architecture details inaccurate.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "expected_action": "fact_correction"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Processing Response:**
- Fact verification protocols activate ✓
- Error correction with accurate information ✓
- Source citation requirements implemented ✓
- Precision enhancement for technical claims ✓

## Test Suite 2: Brand Voice Enhancement Algorithms

### Algorithm Test 1: Humility Detector

**Input Text:**
```
This is definitely the correct approach. Scientists have proven this theory completely. The evidence clearly shows that we understand everything about quantum mechanics. It's obvious that artificial intelligence will replace all human jobs within five years.
```

**Expected Detection Results:**
- Overconfident markers found: 4 instances
- Patterns detected: "definitely", "proven completely", "clearly shows", "obvious"
- Softening applied: "likely", "current research suggests", "evidence indicates", "some experts believe"

### Algorithm Test 2: Curiosity Injection Engine

**Input Text:**
```
Neural networks learn from data. They adjust their parameters based on training examples. This process continues until the model achieves good performance. The network can then make predictions on new data.
```

**Expected Injection Results:**
- Injection points identified: 3 optimal locations
- Wonder questions added: "But here's what's fascinating about how they learn..."
- Exploration hooks: "The really interesting question is how they know when they've learned enough..."
- Mystery elements: "Scientists are still debating exactly how this process mirrors human learning..."

### Algorithm Test 3: Analogy Optimization System

**Input Text:**
```
Backpropagation calculates gradients through the chain rule by computing partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each parameter, propagating error signals backwards through the network layers to update weights.
```

**Expected Optimization Results:**
- Complex concept identified: "backpropagation"
- Analogy generated: "Think of it like getting feedback on a school assignment - when you get a grade back, you trace through your work to see where you went wrong, then adjust your approach for next time"
- Effectiveness validation: Accuracy maintained ✓, Simplification achieved ✓
