          <content>The transformer architecture utilizes self-attention mechanisms to enable parallel processing of sequential data through matrix multiplications in high-dimensional vector spaces. The attention weights are computed via scaled dot-product operations between query, key, and value matrices, allowing the model to selectively focus on relevant input positions while maintaining computational efficiency through parallelizable operations.</content>
