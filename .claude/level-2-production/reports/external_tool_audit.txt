## EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

### MCP SERVER REQUIREMENTS
1. **Perplexity MCP Server**
   - Required for: Research Coordinator agent
   - Setup Command: claude mcp add perplexity
   - API Key Required: Yes
   - Cost Impact: Per-query pricing

2. **ElevenLabs MCP Server**
   - Required for: Audio Synthesizer agent
   - Setup Command: claude mcp add elevenlabs

### COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
- **Pattern Compliance:** Both tools follow mcp__* or approved external patterns
- **Security Assessment:** Both are approved external MCP providers
- **Documentation Status:** Both have proper MCP integration documentation
- **Error Handling:** Both have fallback error handling in agent code

### RISK ASSESSMENT
- **Single Point of Failure:** Each external tool is critical to its agent
- **Cost Control:** Both tools have usage-based pricing models
- **Rate Limiting:** Both providers have rate limits that need management
- **Availability:** Dependent on external provider uptime

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Implement cost monitoring for external tool usage
2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for external calls
3. Consider caching strategies for expensive external operations
4. Monitor external provider status and outages
5. Document fallback procedures for external tool failures
