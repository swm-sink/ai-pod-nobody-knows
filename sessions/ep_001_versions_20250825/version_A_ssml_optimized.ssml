<prosody rate="slow" pitch="medium" volume="soft">
"The more I work in AI, the more I realize how much we don't understand about intelligence—both artificial and natural. We've built systems that can do amazing things, but we often can't explain exactly how they work or why they make the decisions they do."

"The markets are incredibly complex systems influenced by human psychology, technological changes, geopolitical events, and countless other factors.

As we conclude this exploration of intellectual humility, I want to suggest a different way of thinking about intelligence and expertise.

What if intelligence isn't primarily about having the right answers, but about asking the right questions?

<prosody rate="slow" volume="medium-loud">
In a world that seems to reward confidence above all else, choosing intellectual humility requires courage. It takes courage to admit when you don't know something. It takes courage to change your mind. It takes courage to ask questions that might make you look ignorant.

But here's what I've learned from talking to genuine experts across many fields: this courage is what separates true wisdom from mere cleverness.
