Dr. Matthew Walker, despite his influential work on sleep, openly admits in his 2024 interviews that 'we still don't have a complete answer to why we need sleep.' The field has identified several potential functions - memory consolidation, brain waste clearance, energy conservation - but no single theory explains why sleep is universally required across species. Dr. Russell Foster from Oxford notes that 'sleep remains one of the last great biological mysteries' with new discoveries in 2024 challenging previous assumptions about sleep stages and brain activity patterns.",

While Matthew Walker advocates for 8+ hours universally, critics like Dr. Jim Horne argue this ignores genetic variations. The controversy deepened with 2024 genetic studies showing some people genuinely need only 4-6 hours due to rare mutations, but scientists can't predict who has these without expensive genetic testing. Dr. Ying-Hui Fu's research on 'short sleeper' families reveals that sleep needs vary dramatically, but there's no consensus on what determines these differences or whether short sleep is healthy long-term for most people.",
