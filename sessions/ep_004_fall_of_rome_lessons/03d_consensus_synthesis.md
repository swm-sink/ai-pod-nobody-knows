## Evaluator Scores & Weighting

### Individual Evaluator Assessments
```yaml
evaluator_scores:
  quality_claude_enhanced:
    focus: "Brand voice, narrative coherence, engagement optimization"
    weight: 0.35
    overall_score: 0.91
    confidence: "high"

  quality_gemini_enhanced:
    focus: "Technical compliance, production readiness, structural integrity"
    weight: 0.30
    overall_score: 0.93
    confidence: "high"

  quality_perplexity_enhanced:
    focus: "Research accuracy, fact verification, source validation"
    weight: 0.35
    overall_score: 0.89

```

### Weighted Consensus Calculation

**Consensus Formula**: (Claude×0.35) + (Gemini×0.30) + (Perplexity×0.35)

**Calculation**: (0.91×0.35) + (0.93×0.30) + (0.89×0.35) = 0.3185 + 0.279 + 0.3115 = **0.909**
