**Session Handover**: Complete context for fresh chat after Claude Code restart
**Status**: Post-cleanup and reorganization

---

## ✅ RECENT CHANGES (Current Session)

### Project Cleanup Completed
- **README.md**: Simplified and corrected ✅
- **File Organization**: 
  - Moved handover docs to `.claude/sessions/` ✅
  - Moved architecture phases to `.claude/context/foundation/06_architecture_phases.md` ✅
  - Deleted obsolete audit files and backups ✅
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added session handover management section with `/session-handover` command ✅
- **Configuration**: Fixed PERPLEXITY_MODEL to sonar-pro in .env ✅

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What This Is
A **solo hobby project** to build an automated AI podcast production system using Claude Code's native capabilities, producing 100 episodes about the limits of human knowledge.

### Project Philosophy
- **Keep it simple** - This is a hobby project, not enterprise software
- **Use native Claude Code** - Leverage built-in AI for most tasks
- **Minimal external APIs** - Only Perplexity (research) and ElevenLabs (audio)
- **Learn by doing** - Every step teaches AI orchestration concepts

### Architecture Levels
```
Level 2: Native Claude Code Production (CURRENT FOCUS) ✅
├── Claude Code AI (script writing, quality checks)
├── Perplexity MCP (research) - Using sonar-pro model
└── ElevenLabs MCP (audio synthesis)

Level 3: Documentation Only (planning phase)

Level 4: Future Coded Platform (REQUIRES APPROVAL - DO NOT BUILD)
├── OpenRouter (unified model access)
└── Langfuse (evaluation/observability)
```

---

## ✅ WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED

### Phase 1-3: Foundation Architecture ✅
- Four-level architecture established
- Agent builders created
- Command builders ready
- Session coordination framework

### Phase 4: CLAUDE.md Restoration ✅
- Master system prompt v5.0.0
- Educational dual explanations requirement
- Quality enforcement standards
- Session handover management added

### Phase 5: API Configuration ✅
- `.env` file configured with keys
- Perplexity API key: Active
- ElevenLabs API key: Active
- Cost limits set ($5/episode target)

### Phase 6: MCP Installation ✅
- Perplexity MCP installed (Node.js)
- ElevenLabs MCP installed (Python)
- Both configured in `.mcp.json`

### Recent Validation ✅
- All agents use correct MCP tools (perplexity_ask, text_to_speech)
- Outputs go to `projects/nobody-knows/output/`
- Config stays in `.claude/`
- Budgets aligned: Research $3, Script $2.50, Quality $0.50, Audio $2

---

## 🚦 CURRENT STATUS: Phase 7 - Ready to Test

### What's Ready
1. **Agents Configured**:
   - research-coordinator.md → Uses `perplexity_ask` MCP tool
   - script-writer.md → Uses Claude native
   - quality-evaluator.md → Uses Claude native  
   - audio-synthesizer.md → Uses `text_to_speech` MCP tool

2. **Commands Available**:
   - `/produce-episode` - Full production pipeline
   - `/test-episode-dry-run` - Mock testing without API calls
   - `/batch-produce` - Multiple episodes
   - `/session-handover` - Create status documentation

3. **Configuration Complete**:
   - workflow-config.yaml has all settings
   - Quality gates: 0.85 comprehension, 0.90 brand, 0.80 engagement
   - Cost budgets: Total $8 max per episode

---

## 📋 NEXT STEPS (After Restart)

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Restart Claude Code** to load MCP servers
2. **Verify MCPs**: Run `claude mcp list`
3. **Test dry-run**: Execute `/test-episode-dry-run` with "AI for beginners"
4. **Check outputs**: Verify files appear in `projects/nobody-knows/output/`

### Testing Sequence:
```bash
# 1. Verify MCPs loaded
claude mcp list

# 2. Test with mock data (FREE)
claude /test-episode-dry-run --topic "AI for beginners" --episode 1

# 3. If successful, try real production
claude /produce-episode --topic "AI for beginners" --episode 1
```

## 🎯 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### DO:
- ✅ Stay at Level 2 (Native Claude Code)
- ✅ Use MCP servers for external integrations
- ✅ Keep costs under $5 per episode
- ✅ Test with dry-run first
- ✅ Track everything in session files

### DON'T:
- ❌ Build Level 4 without explicit approval
- ❌ Use Python/FastAPI at this stage
- ❌ Create REST APIs
- ❌ Over-engineer the solution
- ❌ Skip the dry-run testing

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If MCPs don't appear:
1. Check `.mcp.json` exists in root
2. Verify paths are absolute
3. Restart Claude Code again
4. Check MCP server logs

### If production fails:
1. Check API keys in `.env`
2. Verify Perplexity credit balance
3. Check ElevenLabs credit balance
4. Review error in session files
5. Try dry-run mode to isolate issue

## 📊 PROJECT METRICS

- **Episodes Target**: 100
- **Cost Target**: <$5 per episode
- **Duration**: 27 minutes each
- **Quality Target**: >0.85 overall score
- **Current Phase**: 7 of 8 (87.5% complete for Level 2)

## 🎓 LEARNING FOCUS

You're learning:
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Cost optimization strategies
- Quality gate implementation
- MCP integration techniques
- Session state management
- Context engineering vs prompt engineering

Remember: Every error teaches something valuable. This is YOUR learning journey!
