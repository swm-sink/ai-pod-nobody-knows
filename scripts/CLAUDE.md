## üéØ SCRIPTS UTILITY CONTEXT

**Technical:** Utility scripts memory implementing system operations, maintenance automation, pre-commit validation, deployment tools, and operational utilities supporting the AI podcast production infrastructure.

**Simple:** Like having a toolbox full of helpful scripts that automate boring tasks and keep the system running smoothly.

**Connection:** This teaches automation scripting, system operations, and utility development essential for maintainable AI systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è SCRIPT ARCHITECTURE

### **Pre-commit Scripts**
<LOAD_IF task="precommit|validation|quality|checking">
```yaml
validation_scripts:
  duplication_detection: "Prevent duplicate files and content"
  naming_conventions: "Enforce file naming standards"
  security_scanning: "Detect potential secrets in commits"
  quality_validation: "Educational dual explanations verification"
  
automation_benefits:
  consistency: "Automatic enforcement of project standards"
  quality: "Prevent common mistakes before they reach repository"
  security: "Protect against accidental secret commits"
```
</LOAD_IF>

### **System Operations**
<LOAD_IF task="operations|maintenance|system|admin">
```yaml
operational_scripts:
  system_health: "Comprehensive system status checking"
  log_management: "Log rotation and cleanup automation"
  cost_reconciliation: "Budget and spending reconciliation"
  backup_management: "Automated backup and recovery"
  
maintenance_automation:
  daily_cleanup: "Temporary file cleanup and optimization"
  weekly_reports: "System performance and cost analysis"
  monthly_archives: "Session data archival and cleanup"
```
</LOAD_IF>

### **Development Utilities**
<LOAD_IF task="development|utility|helper|tool">
```yaml
development_tools:
  environment_setup: "Development environment initialization"
  testing_utilities: "Test data generation and validation"
  deployment_helpers: "Production deployment automation"
  
developer_experience:
  quick_setup: "One-command development environment"
  testing_shortcuts: "Rapid testing and validation"
  debugging_tools: "System debugging and diagnostics"
```
</LOAD_IF>

## ‚ö° SCRIPT COORDINATION

### **Integration Patterns**
```yaml
script_integration:
  hook_system: "Scripts called by .claude/hooks/ automation"
  command_support: "Utilities supporting command workflows"
  validation_pipeline: "Quality and security validation automation"
  
operational_reliability:
  error_handling: "Graceful failure and recovery patterns"
  logging: "Comprehensive operation logging"
  monitoring: "System health and performance tracking"
```

### **Automation Philosophy**
- **Minimize Manual Work**: Automate repetitive operations
- **Quality Enforcement**: Automatic validation and standards checking
- **Cost Protection**: Budget monitoring and spending controls
- **Developer Experience**: Make common tasks simple and fast
