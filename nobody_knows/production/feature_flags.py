Feature Flag System - Enhanced with Backward Compatibility (REFACTOR PHASE)
============================================================================

This maintains backward compatibility with tests while using the enhanced
production-ready implementation under the hood.

Educational: Shows how REFACTOR phase maintains test compatibility while
significantly improving code quality.

# Import enhanced implementation
from .feature_flags_enhanced import (
    FeatureFlagManager as EnhancedFeatureFlagManager,
    FeatureFlag as EnhancedFeatureFlag,
    ABTestConfig as EnhancedABTestConfig,
    ShadowModeConfig as EnhancedShadowModeConfig,
    CostOptimizationFlags as EnhancedCostOptimizationFlags,
    FeatureFlagException as EnhancedFeatureFlagException
)

# Create backward-compatible aliases that use enhanced implementation
FeatureFlagException = EnhancedFeatureFlagException

# Educational Notes:
"""
GREEN PHASE IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES:

1. **Just Enough**: Only implement what makes tests pass
2. **Simple Data Structures**: Use basic dict/list, optimize later
3. **Minimal Logic**: Simple if/else, complex algorithms in REFACTOR
4. **Placeholder Methods**: Some methods just return basic values
5. **No Premature Optimization**: Focus on correctness, not performance

WHAT'S MISSING (intentionally, for REFACTOR phase):
- Advanced error handling
- Performance optimizations  
- Complex validation logic
- Monitoring and metrics
- Database persistence
- Distributed coordination

This is exactly what TDD teaches - build incrementally!
