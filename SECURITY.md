## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the AI Podcast Production System, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: [your-email@domain.com] (replace with actual contact)
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Response Time**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Updates**: You will receive updates on the status within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

## Security Measures

### API Key Protection
- All API keys are stored in environment variables only
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use `.env` files (git-ignored) for local development
- Production keys are managed through secure deployment systems

### Data Security
- Episode data is stored locally with optional archival compression
- No sensitive user data is collected or transmitted
- All API communications use HTTPS
- Voice synthesis data is processed through secure third-party APIs

### Code Security
- Dependencies are regularly updated for security patches
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Static code analysis for vulnerability detection
- Secure coding practices enforced in development

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege for all operations
- Secure secret management systems
- Regular credential rotation procedures
- Audit trails for security-sensitive operations

## Dependencies

This project uses the following external services. Please review their security policies:

- **ElevenLabs**: Audio synthesis (https://elevenlabs.io/security)
- **Anthropic Claude**: Script generation (https://www.anthropic.com/security)
- **Google Gemini**: Quality evaluation (https://cloud.google.com/security)
- **Perplexity**: Research queries (https://perplexity.ai/privacy)

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Use unique, strong API keys for each service
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage for unusual activity

2. **Local Security**:
   - Keep your `.env` file secure and never share it
   - Use proper file permissions (600) for sensitive files
   - Regularly update dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Use container environments with restricted access
   - Implement network security policies
   - Enable logging and monitoring
   - Regular security assessments

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke compromised API keys immediately
   - Review access logs for unauthorized activity
   - Document the incident timeline

2. **Communication**:
   - Report the incident to relevant stakeholders
   - Update affected users if necessary
   - Coordinate with third-party service providers

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement fixes and security improvements
   - Test all systems thoroughly
   - Update documentation and procedures

## Compliance

This system is designed to comply with:
- General data protection principles
- Industry standard security practices
- Third-party service terms of service
- Open source license requirements
