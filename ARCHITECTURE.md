## 🔧 Component Architecture

### 1. Context Engineering Layer

**Design Pattern**: Selective Loading with Token Budgeting

```yaml
context_architecture:
  mandatory_context: "4K tokens maximum"
  optional_context: "6K tokens maximum"
  working_memory: "2K tokens reserved"

  loading_strategy:
    entry_point: "CLAUDE.md (navigation hub)"
    hop_limit: 2  # Never exceed 2 hops
    priority: "MANDATORY > SYSTEM > AGENT > REFERENCE > OPTIONAL"
```

**Files**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Master configuration (12K token budget)
- `.claude/context/` - 15 core context files (max enforced)
- `.claude/agent-context/` - Domain-specific navigation

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Design Pattern**: Direct Sub-Agent Invocation (Not Task Tool)

```yaml
orchestration_pattern:
  main_chat: "Coordinates overall workflow"
  specialized_agents: "Domain-specific agents invoked by name"
  tool_inheritance: "Agents inherit MCP tools when properly configured"
  quality_gates: "Built-in validation and consensus systems"
```

**Agent Specialization**:
- **Research Stream** (4 agents): Discovery → Deep Research → Questions → Synthesis
- **Production Stream** (10 agents): Planning → Writing → Quality → Polish → Audio

### 3. MCP Integration Layer

**Design Pattern**: Tool Inheritance with Configuration Management

```yaml
mcp_architecture:
  tool_access: "Sub-agents inherit ALL MCP tools when tools field omitted"
  server_access: "Perplexity for research, ElevenLabs for audio"
  configuration: "Environment variables with fallback patterns"

  validated_servers:
    perplexity: "✓ Connected - Research and fact-checking"
    elevenlabs: "✓ Connected - Text-to-speech synthesis"
    langfuse: "✓ Connected - Prompt management"
    playwright: "✓ Connected - Browser automation"
```
