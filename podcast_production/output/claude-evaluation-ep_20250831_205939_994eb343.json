  "strengths": [
    "Excellent integration of intellectual humility throughout the script, with multiple instances of acknowledging uncertainty and expert disagreement",
    "Strong opening hook that immediately establishes curiosity and frames the topic as an ongoing mystery",
    "Sophisticated use of storytelling to make complex concepts accessible without oversimplification",
    "Natural integration of expert voices that show researchers as curious explorers rather than infallible authorities"
  ],
  "improvements": [
    "Consider adding more specific examples in the middle section to maintain engagement during technical explanations",
    "The transition between sections 3 and 4 could be smoother with a stronger connecting thread",
    "Could strengthen the conclusion with more explicit connections to listeners' everyday experiences",
    "Some technical terms could benefit from brief analogies to enhance accessibility"
