## Multi-Model Consensus System

### Complementary Evaluation Framework

**Claude's Strengths:**
- Creative content assessment
- Narrative flow and storytelling
- Brand voice consistency
- Engagement and emotional connection
- Intellectual humility integration

**Gemini's Strengths:**
- Technical accuracy verification
- Scientific rigor assessment
- Logical structure analysis
- Factual precision validation
- Analytical clarity evaluation

### Consensus Rules

1. **Passing Threshold:** Both evaluators must score > 7.5/10 to pass
2. **Disagreement Detection:** Flag for review if scores differ by >2 points
3. **Combined Insights:** Merge perspectives for comprehensive feedback
4. **Quality Gate:** Advance to production only with dual approval

## Implementation Features

### Core Architecture
- **LangGraph Node Integration:** Both agents implement async `execute()` method
- **State Management:** Uses `PodcastState` TypedDict for consistent data flow
- **Cost Tracking:** Real-time budget monitoring and optimization
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error management with graceful fallbacks

### Quality Assurance
- **Mock Responses:** Built-in testing responses for development
- **Fallback Parsing:** Robust JSON parsing with regex fallbacks
- **Budget Enforcement:** Hard limits prevent cost overruns
- **Comprehensive Logging:** LangFuse integration for observability

### Output Management
- **JSON Storage:** Results saved to `output/{evaluator}-evaluation-{session}.json`
- **State Integration:** Quality scores merged into workflow state
- **Cross-Evaluator Context:** Prepared for consensus system integration
