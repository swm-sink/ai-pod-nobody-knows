            ## Strengths Identified:
            - Uses phrases like "appears to suggest" and "current understanding indicates"
            - Acknowledges expert disagreements and ongoing research
            - Avoids absolute statements, using qualifiers appropriately

            ## Minor Issues:
            - One instance of slightly overconfident phrasing in paragraph 3
            - Could benefit from more explicit uncertainty acknowledgment

            ## Suggested Improvements:
            - Replace "This proves that..." with "This evidence suggests that..."
            - Add more expert humility moments showing researchers as curious learners
