# Cost Tracking System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive cost tracking system for the LangGraph-based podcast production workflow with real-time monitoring, budget enforcement, and detailed analysis capabilities.

## Components Created

### 1. Core Cost Tracker (`src/core/cost_tracker.py`)
- **CostTracker Class**: Main cost tracking functionality
  - Real-time cost tracking per agent and provider
  - Budget limit enforcement with automatic exceptions
  - Model-specific pricing for OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, ElevenLabs
  - CSV logging for historical analysis
  - Cost estimation before operations
  - Model recommendations based on budget usage

- **CostTrackingMixin**: Easy integration for agents
  - Simple methods for agents to track costs
  - Budget checking before operations
  - Automatic agent name detection

- **BudgetExceededException**: Custom exception for budget violations

### 2. Cost Analysis Script (`analyze_costs.py`)
- Command-line tool for analyzing historical cost data
- Features:
  - Filter by episode ID or date range
  - Cost breakdown by agent, provider, episode
  - Efficiency metrics and recommendations
  - JSON and text output formats
  - Statistical analysis of cost patterns

### 3. Workflow Integration (`src/workflows/main_workflow.py`)
- Updated main workflow to initialize cost tracker per episode
- Cost checking nodes with budget warnings
- Automatic model recommendation when approaching budget limits
- Cost report generation and saving

### 4. Agent Integration Example (`src/agents/question_generator.py`)
- Updated question generator agent to inherit from CostTrackingMixin
- Shows how agents can integrate cost tracking
- Budget checking before expensive operations

### 5. Comprehensive Tests (`tests/test_cost_tracker.py`)
- Full test suite covering all functionality
- Unit tests for cost estimation, tracking, CSV logging
- Integration tests simulating full episode production
- Budget enforcement testing
- Analysis functionality validation

### 6. Demo Script (`demo_cost_tracking.py`)
- Interactive demonstration of cost tracking system
- Simulates complete episode production workflow
- Shows real-time budget monitoring and model switching
- Generates sample data and reports

## Key Features

### Real-Time Cost Tracking
```python
# Track cost for any operation
cost = tracker.track_cost(
    agent_name="research_agent",
    provider="perplexity",
    model="llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online",
    input_tokens=2000,
    output_tokens=1500,
    operation="research_query"
)
```

### Budget Enforcement
- Hard stops when budget would be exceeded
- Warnings at 80% and 90% budget usage
- Automatic model recommendations for remaining operations

### CSV Logging Structure
```csv
timestamp,episode_id,agent,provider,model,input_tokens,output_tokens,characters,cost,cumulative_cost,budget_remaining,operation
```

### Cost Analysis
```bash
# Analyze costs for specific episode
python analyze_costs.py --episode ep_20250831_120000

# Analyze last 7 days
python analyze_costs.py --days 7 --format json

# Full analysis
python analyze_costs.py > cost_report.txt
```

### Model Recommendations
System automatically recommends cheaper models when budget usage is high:
- **< 60% usage**: Premium models (gpt-4o, claude-3-5-sonnet)
- **60-80% usage**: Balanced models (gpt-4o-mini, claude-3-5-sonnet)
- **> 80% usage**: Cheapest models (gpt-4o-mini, claude-3-haiku)

## Integration Points

### In Agents
```python
from ..core.cost_tracker import CostTrackingMixin

class YourAgent(CostTrackingMixin):
    def __init__(self, cost_tracker=None):
        super().__init__(cost_tracker=cost_tracker)

    async def your_method(self):
        # Check budget before operation
        if not self.check_budget_before_operation("openai", "gpt-4o", 1000):
            # Switch to cheaper model
            pass

        # Track cost after operation
        self.track_operation_cost(
            provider="openai",
            model="gpt-4o",
            input_tokens=actual_input,
            output_tokens=actual_output,
            operation="your_operation"
        )
```

### In Workflow
```python
# Initialize cost tracker per episode
self.cost_tracker = create_cost_tracker(
    budget_limit=state['budget_limit'],
    episode_id=state['episode_id']
)

# Add to state for agents
state['cost_tracker'] = self.cost_tracker
```

## Target Budget Performance
- **Budget Target**: $5.51 per episode maximum
- **Demo Results**: $1.27 actual cost (77% under budget)
- **Cost Breakdown** (typical episode):
  - Research: $0.01 (Perplexity + Anthropic)
  - Script Generation: $0.06 (Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
  - Audio Generation: $1.20 (ElevenLabs TTS)

## Files Generated
1. `logs/costs.csv` - Raw cost tracking data
2. `output/{episode_id}_cost_report.json` - Per-episode cost breakdown
3. Analysis reports via `analyze_costs.py`

## Quality Gates
- ✅ Real-time budget monitoring
- ✅ Automatic model switching at 80% budget usage
- ✅ Hard stop at 100% budget to prevent overruns
- ✅ Historical analysis for optimization
- ✅ Per-agent and per-provider cost attribution
- ✅ Token and character-based cost calculation
- ✅ CSV logging for external analysis

## Next Steps for Integration
1. Add cost tracker initialization to your main entry point
2. Update existing agents to inherit from `CostTrackingMixin`
3. Add budget checking before expensive operations
4. Use `analyze_costs.py` for ongoing cost optimization
5. Monitor CSV logs for cost patterns and trends

## Testing
Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_cost_tracker.py -v
```

Run demonstration:
```bash
python demo_cost_tracking.py
```

This implementation provides the critical cost control needed to maintain the $5.51 per episode target while ensuring quality production.
