  "strengths": [
    "Precise technical terminology with accurate definitions throughout, particularly in the explanation of quantum mechanics principles",
    "Strong logical flow with clear cause-effect relationships that build understanding systematically",

    "Balanced presentation of competing theories with fair representation of evidence for each perspective"

  "improvements": [
    "Technical correction needed: The description of wave-particle duality in paragraph 4 oversimplifies the Copenhagen interpretation",
    "Clearer explanation required for the concept of measurement in quantum mechanics - current analogy may confuse general audience",
    "Citation format could be improved: Expert quotes need clearer attribution with credentials and institutional affiliation",
