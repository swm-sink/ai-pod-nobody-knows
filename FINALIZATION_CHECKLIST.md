### **15. Quality Consistency**
**Status**: ðŸ”´ CONSENSUS SYSTEM NEEDS TESTING  
**Action**: Test 3-evaluator consensus produces reliable, consistent scores  
**Success Criteria**: Quality scores consistent across multiple episodes  
**Risk**: High - Quality system preserved but real-world reliability unknown

### **16. Batch Processing Capability**
**Status**: ðŸ”´ UNKNOWN FUNCTIONALITY  
**Action**: Test if batch-processor agent actually works or is theoretical

## ðŸ“‹ HANDOFF NOTES

### **What's Definitely Working**
- MCP servers connected and functional
- Setup scripts provide accurate validation
- Agent and command files preserved with working examples
- Voice configuration validated and preserved
- Git workflow functions normally

### **What Definitely Needs Work**
- Real API testing (current tests use placeholder keys)
- Cost claims validation (deleted the evidence, need to recreate)
- Session state management (deleted complex system, need minimal replacement)
- Documentation accuracy (major changes require verification)

### **Critical Success Factors**
- Preserve working agent functionality while testing
- Focus on usability over architectural purity
- Validate claims with real evidence, not assumptions
- Maintain minimum viable complexity principle

**System Status**: Organized and ready for final validation and production deployment.
