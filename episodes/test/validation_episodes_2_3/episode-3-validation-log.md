### Stage 2: RESEARCH - Consciousness Studies Domain Analysis

#### Consciousness Research Landscape (Simulated Findings)

**Major Consciousness Mysteries Perfect for "Nobody Knows":**

1. **The Hard Problem of Consciousness** (David Chalmers, 1995)
   - Experience vs. computation distinction
   - Why anything feels like anything at all
   - Explanatory gap between neural activity and subjective experience
   - Perfect intellectual humility: "We can map the brain but not explain experience"

2. **Competing Consciousness Theories** (Current active debate)
   - Global Workspace Theory (Bernard Baars)
   - Integrated Information Theory (Giulio Tononi)
   - Attention Schema Theory (Michael Graziano)
   - Each explains some phenomena, none explain everything

3. **The Binding Problem** (How unity emerges from distributed processing)
   - Neural synchrony hypothesis
   - Feature integration mystery
   - Temporal binding mechanisms
   - Still actively researched with no consensus

4. **Free Will vs. Determinism** (Neuroscience meets philosophy)
   - Libet experiments and timing of conscious decision
   - Compatibilist vs. hard determinist positions
   - Recent findings complicate simple determinism

5. **Consciousness in Non-Human Systems** (Where does consciousness begin?)
   - Animal consciousness markers
   - AI consciousness possibility
   - Plant intelligence debates
   - Panpsychist perspectives
