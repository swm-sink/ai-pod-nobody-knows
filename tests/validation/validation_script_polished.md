## TTS Preparation Optimization ✅

### Speech Optimization Enhancements
```ssml
<speak>
  <p>Imagine two particles, born from the same quantum event,
     <break time="1s"/> separated by the vast darkness of space.</p>

  <p>Albert Einstein called it <emphasis level="moderate">spooky action at a distance</emphasis>,
     <break time="1s"/> and he hated it so much that he spent the last decades of his life
     trying to prove it couldn't be real.</p>

  <p>The Nobel Prize-winning physicist <break time="0.5s"/> Richard Feynman <break time="0.5s"/>
     once said, <emphasis level="strong">"Nobody understands quantum mechanics."</emphasis></p>
</speak>
```

### Pronunciation Guidance Enhanced
