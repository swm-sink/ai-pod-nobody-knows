# Episode Planning Input - Validation Test

## Research Package Integration
**Topic**: "The Mystery of Quantum Entanglement - What Scientists Still Don't Understand"

**Research Quality Scores**:
- Research completeness: 0.90 ✅
- Source credibility: 0.88 ✅
- Factual accuracy: 0.92 ✅
- Brand alignment: 0.85 ✅

**Key Research Insights**:
- Einstein's "spooky action at a distance" remains fundamentally unexplained
- Bell's theorem proves quantum mechanics violates classical local realism
- Quantum entanglement enables revolutionary computing and cryptography applications
- The mechanism of instantaneous quantum information transfer is completely unknown

**Nobody Knows Moments** (Critical for intellectual humility):
1. How does information travel instantaneously between entangled particles across vast distances?
2. What is the true nature of quantum reality beneath the mathematical formalism?
3. How do quantum measurements actually collapse superposition states?

**Production Requirements**:
- Target duration: 47 minutes (45-49 minute acceptable range)
- Budget allocation: $25.75 total ($2.00 for this stage)
- Brand alignment requirement: >0.90
- Quality gate thresholds: All >0.85
