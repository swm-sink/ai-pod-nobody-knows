The cat sat on the mat. The dog ran to the park. Birds fly high in the sky. Fish swim in the sea. 

Kids like to play games. They run and jump. They laugh and sing. The sun is bright today.

Mom makes good food. Dad reads big books. We eat lunch at noon. Night comes after day.

School is fun for many kids. Teachers help us learn new things. Math and reading are important subjects.
