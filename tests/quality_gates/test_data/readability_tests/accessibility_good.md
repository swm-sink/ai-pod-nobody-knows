Artificial intelligence helps computers think like humans. However, these machines work differently than our brains. Therefore, scientists study both to understand intelligence better.

Think of AI like a very smart calculator. It can solve complex problems quickly. Meanwhile, humans are better at creative tasks and emotional understanding.

Current research focuses on making AI more helpful and safe. Furthermore, scientists want these systems to explain their decisions clearly. This helps people trust and understand the technology better.

Nobody knows exactly how far AI will advance. Consequently, researchers work carefully to ensure positive outcomes for society.
