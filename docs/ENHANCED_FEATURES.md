# Enhanced Production Features (September 2025)

## Overview

This document describes three major enhancements to the AI Podcast Production System:

1. **Multi-Provider Failover** - Automatic API failover with health monitoring
2. **Parallel Processing** - Concurrent task execution in LangGraph workflows
3. **Brand Consistency Engine** - ML-based brand voice validation

## 1. Multi-Provider Failover

### Purpose
Ensures high availability and reliability by automatically switching between API providers when failures occur.

### Key Features
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks every 60 seconds
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Multiple Strategies**: Round-robin, weighted, priority, least-latency, adaptive
- **Real-time Metrics**: Latency, success rate, error tracking

### Usage

```python
from core.provider_failover import ProviderFailoverManager, ProviderConfig, LoadBalancingStrategy

# Configure providers
providers = [
    ProviderConfig(
        name="perplexity",
        base_url="https://api.perplexity.ai",
        api_key="your-key",
        priority=1,
        weight=2.0,
        models=["llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online"]
    ),
    # Add more providers...
]

# Initialize failover manager
failover = ProviderFailoverManager(
    providers=providers,
    strategy=LoadBalancingStrategy.ADAPTIVE
)

# Start health monitoring
await failover.start()

# Execute with automatic failover
result = await failover.execute_with_failover(
    operation="chat/completions",
    payload={"query": "Your research query"},
    model="llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online"
)
```

### Provider Health States
- **HEALTHY**: Latency < 1000ms, no recent errors
- **DEGRADED**: Latency 1000-3000ms or occasional errors
- **UNHEALTHY**: Latency > 3000ms or consistent failures
- **UNKNOWN**: Not yet checked

### Load Balancing Strategies
- **ROUND_ROBIN**: Equal distribution across providers
- **WEIGHTED**: Distribution based on configured weights
- **PRIORITY**: Always use highest priority available
- **LEAST_LATENCY**: Route to fastest provider
- **ADAPTIVE**: Smart routing based on composite health scores

## 2. Parallel Processing

### Purpose
Accelerates workflow execution by running independent tasks concurrently.

### Key Features
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic task ordering based on dependencies
- **Priority Scheduling**: Execute critical tasks first
- **Resource Management**: Limit concurrent executions
- **State Isolation**: Prevent state conflicts during parallel execution

### Parallelizable Workflow Stages

#### Research Phase
```python
# These tasks run in parallel:
- research_academic    # Academic sources
- research_news       # News and current events
- research_expert     # Expert opinions and interviews
```

#### Quality Evaluation
```python
# These evaluations run simultaneously:
- claude_evaluation   # Claude's quality assessment
- gemini_evaluation   # Gemini's perspective
- brand_validation    # Brand consistency check
```

#### Production Preprocessing
```python
# Parallel preprocessing:
- ssml_preprocessing  # Convert to SSML format
- chunk_optimization  # Optimize for audio synthesis
```

### Usage

```python
from core.parallel_executor import ParallelExecutor, ParallelTask, TaskPriority

# Initialize executor
executor = ParallelExecutor(
    max_concurrent=5,
    enable_monitoring=True
)

# Define parallel tasks
tasks = [
    ParallelTask(
        task_id="task1",
        function=async_function,
        priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
        dependencies={"task0": DependencyType.REQUIRES}
    ),
    # More tasks...
]

# Execute in parallel
result = await executor.execute_parallel(
    tasks,
    state,
    merge_strategy="update"
)
```

### Dependency Types
- **REQUIRES**: Must complete before this task
- **CONFLICTS**: Cannot run simultaneously
- **PREFERS**: Soft dependency (optimization hint)

### Merge Strategies
- **update**: Update existing fields (default)
- **append**: Append to lists
- **replace**: Replace entirely

## 3. Brand Consistency Engine

### Purpose
Ensures all content maintains the "Nobody Knows" podcast's distinctive voice of intellectual humility and curiosity.

### Key Features
- **ML-based Scoring**: Uses sentence transformers for semantic analysis
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: 8 different brand dimensions
- **Drift Detection**: Identifies when content strays from brand
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves from successful content
- **Detailed Recommendations**: Specific improvement suggestions

### Brand Dimensions

1. **Intellectual Humility** (0-1)
   - Acknowledgment of uncertainty
   - Phrases like "we don't fully understand", "scientists are still learning"

2. **Curiosity Quotient** (0-1)
   - Wonder and exploration
   - "Have you ever wondered?", "What's fascinating is..."

3. **Question Ratio** (0-1)
   - Percentage of sentences that are questions
   - Engages audience through inquiry

4. **Uncertainty Acknowledgment** (0-1)
   - Use of tentative language
   - "might", "could", "perhaps", "possibly"

5. **Exploration Language** (0-1)
   - Discovery-focused vocabulary
   - "explore", "investigate", "discover", "examine"

6. **Citation Density** (0-1)
   - References to research and studies
   - "research shows", "scientists found", "studies indicate"

7. **Tone Consistency** (0-1)
   - Consistent emotional tone
   - Measured by sentiment variance

8. **Vocabulary Sophistication** (0-1)
   - Appropriate complexity level
   - Not too simple, not too academic

### Usage

```python
from core.brand_consistency import BrandConsistencyEngine

# Initialize engine
brand_engine = BrandConsistencyEngine(
    model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    exemplar_path="./brand_exemplars.json"
)

# Validate content
result = await brand_engine.validate_content(
    content=script_text,
    category="episode_script",
    strict_mode=False  # Use 0.85 threshold (vs 0.9 for strict)
)

# Check results
if result["passes"]:
    print(f"Brand consistency score: {result['composite_score']}")
else:
    print(f"Failed brand check. Score: {result['composite_score']}")
    print(f"Recommendations: {result['recommendations']}")
```

### Scoring Thresholds
- **Standard Mode**: 0.85 minimum composite score
- **Strict Mode**: 0.90 minimum composite score
- **Drift Warning**: 15% deviation from baseline triggers alert

### Example Recommendations
- "Add more phrases acknowledging uncertainty"
- "Incorporate more curiosity-driven language"
- "Include more questions to engage the audience"
- "Use more tentative language where appropriate"
- "Add exploration-focused vocabulary"

## Integration with Enhanced Workflow

The `enhanced_workflow.py` integrates all three features:

```python
from workflows.enhanced_workflow import EnhancedPodcastWorkflow

# Initialize with all enhancements
workflow = EnhancedPodcastWorkflow({
    "max_parallel": 5,
    "perplexity_api_key": "key",
    "brand_exemplars": "./brand_exemplars.json"
})

# Execute with all features active
result = await workflow.execute(initial_state)

# Get comprehensive metrics
metrics = workflow.get_workflow_metrics()
print(f"Parallel tasks executed: {metrics['parallel_execution']['completed']}")
print(f"Provider health: {metrics['provider_health']}")
print(f"Brand consistency: {metrics['brand_consistency']}")
```
