```

   - Identify knowledge gaps and uncertainties

2. **Script Creation** (5 minutes, ~$1)  
   - Write 28-minute episode script
   - Add intellectual humility moments
   - Optimize for audio synthesis

3. **Quality Validation** (3 minutes, ~$0.50)
   - Three-evaluator consensus (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
   - Brand consistency checking
   - Technical accuracy verification

4. **Audio Synthesis** (2 minutes, ~$2.50)
   - Professional voice synthesis (Amelia)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues
```bash
# Check MCP status
claude mcp list

# Should show:
# ‚úì Connected: perplexity
# ‚úì Connected: elevenlabs
```

**Fix**: If not connected, run `./scripts/setup-mcp.sh` again

### High Costs  
**Problem**: Episode costs more than expected

**Solutions**:
- Check `.claude/logs/cost-tracking.log` for details
- Reduce research depth for simpler topics
- Use single episodes before batch processing

### Quality Issues
**Problem**: Episode doesn't pass quality gates

**Solutions**:
- Check quality evaluation reports in episode session
- All episodes automatically pass 85%+ thresholds
- System has built-in retry logic for improvements

### API Errors
**Problem**: 401 authentication errors

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Test API keys directly
curl -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_KEY" https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/models
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions
```

**Fix**: If keys don't work, regenerate them on the respective platforms
