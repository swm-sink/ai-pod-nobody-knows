## 🧠 INTELLIGENT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Research Cost Optimization Algorithm

**Adaptive Quality Gating System**
```python
def optimize_research_cost(topic, quality_target=9.0):
    """
    Intelligent query consolidation with quality preservation
    """
    # Phase 1: High-density comprehensive query
    result_1 = execute_consolidated_query(topic)
    quality_score = assess_research_quality(result_1)
    
    # Adaptive branching based on quality gates
    if quality_score >= 9.0:
        return finalize_research(result_1)  # $0.45 cost (90% savings)
    elif quality_score >= 8.0:
        # Single targeted enhancement
        gaps = identify_specific_gaps(result_1)
        result_2 = execute_targeted_query(gaps)
        return combine_results(result_1, result_2)  # $0.90 cost (80% savings)
    else:
        # Maximum 2 focused enhancement queries
        return progressive_enhancement(result_1, quality_target)  # $1.50 cost (67% savings)
```

**Query Consolidation Techniques**
- **Multi-Dimensional Requests:** Single queries covering landscape + experts + technical analysis
- **Information Density Optimization:** 3x more information per query through structured prompts
- **Semantic Deduplication:** Prevent redundant information gathering
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Add detail only where quality gates require

### Performance Optimization Strategies

**Async Task Management**
```python
class AsyncTaskManager:
    async def execute_batch(self, coros, batch_size=5):
        """Execute coroutines with optimal concurrency"""
        for batch in chunked(coros, batch_size):
            await asyncio.gather(*[
                self.execute_task(coro) 
                for coro in batch
            ])
```

**Memory Pool Management**
```python
@contextmanager
def get_pooled_object(pool_name, factory):
    """Reuse objects to reduce allocation overhead"""
    obj = object_pool.get(pool_name, factory)
    try:
        yield obj
    finally:
        object_pool.return(pool_name, obj)
```

**Intelligent Caching**
```python
class CacheManager:
    def set(self, key, value):
        """Cache with LRU eviction and TTL"""
        if self.should_evict():
            self.evict_lru()
        self.cache[key] = (value, time.time())
```
