## 🎯 Our Philosophy

**"Nobody Knows"** - We celebrate intellectual humility. We value questions as much as answers, learning as much as teaching, and clarity over cleverness.

**Core Values:**
- 🎓 **Education First**: Every contribution should teach something
- 🤝 **Intellectual Humility**: Admit what we don't know
- 📚 **Dual Explanations**: Technical AND simple explanations
- 🔄 **Iterative Learning**: Start simple, grow complex
- 💡 **Practical Application**: Learn by building real things

## 📚 Educational Requirements

### The Feynman Rule
Every technical concept MUST have:
1. **Technical explanation** - Industry-standard terminology
2. **Simple explanation** - Like teaching a curious friend
3. **Practical example** - Real-world application
4. **Learning connection** - Transferable skills gained

### Example Documentation
```xml
<concept name="Token Optimization">
    <technical>
        Reducing token consumption through prompt compression,
        response caching, and model cascading strategies
    </technical>
    <simple>
        Like packing a suitcase efficiently - fitting more
        into less space while keeping everything you need
    </simple>
    <example>
        Cache research results to avoid repeated API calls,
        saving 42% on monthly costs
    </example>
    <connection>
        Teaches resource optimization applicable to any
        API-based system
    </connection>
</concept>
```
