# Episode Eight: The Art of Asking AI to Think

Two weeks ago, a financial analyst was struggling with a complex budget forecast that wasn't making sense. His first attempt: "Analyze this budget data." The AI provided a basic summary of spending categories and percentage changes. Helpful, but not insightful. Then he tried something different: "Let's work through this budget analysis step by step. First, help me identify spending categories where increases exceeded our projections by more than ten percent. Then, let's examine what external factors might explain these variances. Finally, let's consider what this pattern suggests about our assumptions for next quarter." <break time="0.5s" /> Same data, same AI, but this approach unlocked reasoning capabilities that transformed his analysis.

That phrase—"let's work through this step by step"—unlocks what Google's researchers call chain-of-thought reasoning. In their PaLM study, this technique improved complex reasoning accuracy from forty-three percent to sixty-seven percent. But here's what fascinated me: the improvement wasn't just in getting right answers. It was in seeing how the AI thinks about problems.

You've learned to be specific and collaborative in your AI communication. Now we're adding the most powerful technique: asking AI to show its reasoning process. When you combine specificity, politeness, and systematic thinking, you create what I call expert-level AI dialogue.

Here's what happens when you ask AI to think step by step: instead of jumping directly to conclusions, the AI maps out its logical pathway, considers multiple factors, and builds toward solutions systematically. You get to see the reasoning process, not just the final answer.

Think of it like the difference between asking someone for a quick opinion versus asking them to walk you through their analysis. The quick opinion might be right, but the reasoned explanation reveals assumptions, trade-offs, and insights you wouldn't discover otherwise.

When AI systems learned from billions of examples of human communication, they absorbed not just final answers but entire thought processes. Teachers explaining step-by-step solutions. Experts breaking down complex problems. Researchers showing their methodology.

When you ask AI to "think through" something, you're activating these reasoning patterns. You're saying: "Don't just give me your conclusion—show me how you arrived there."

Let me show you what this looks like across different types of challenges.

For analytical problems, try: "Let's examine this systematically. What patterns do you notice in this data, and what factors might explain them?" This triggers methodical analysis rather than surface-level observations.

For creative challenges: "Let's explore this problem from multiple angles. What are some conventional approaches, and how might we think about this differently?" This encourages broader ideation and alternative perspectives.

For strategic decisions: "Let's work through this decision carefully. What are the key factors we should consider, and how do the short-term and long-term implications compare?" This activates comprehensive evaluation rather than quick judgment.

But here's where this becomes really powerful: when AI shows its reasoning, you can guide and improve that reasoning in real time. It's like having a thought partner who's willing to show their work and accept feedback.

You might say: "That's logical reasoning, but in our industry, regulatory compliance is actually more important than cost savings. How would that priority change your analysis?" Or: "I see your approach, but you're missing information about our customer feedback patterns. Let me add that context and see how it affects your conclusion."

This is collaborative thinking at its best. The AI provides systematic analysis framework, and you provide context, priorities, and judgment that the AI can't access independently.

Here's something that surprised me: this technique works best for complex problems but can actually hurt performance on simple tasks. Asking AI to think step by step about basic factual questions sometimes leads to overthinking and less accurate results.

The key is recognizing when systematic reasoning adds value versus when it creates unnecessary complexity. Use step-by-step thinking for analysis, evaluation, planning, and problem-solving. Use direct requests for straightforward information retrieval or simple creative tasks.

Let me give you a practical example of systematic thinking in action. Instead of "help me improve team productivity," try: "Let's analyze our team productivity challenge systematically. First, what are the main factors that typically impact team productivity? Second, which of these factors seem most relevant to our remote work situation? Third, what interventions could we implement that would address our highest-impact factors? Finally, how would we measure whether these interventions are working?"

This approach doesn't just give you suggestions—it gives you a framework for thinking about productivity that you can apply beyond this specific situation.

You know what's remarkable about asking AI to show its reasoning? You often discover considerations you hadn't thought of yourself. The AI draws from patterns across countless similar problems to identify factors that might not be obvious in your specific context.

For example, when I asked AI to help evaluate a hiring decision using systematic reasoning, it didn't just assess skills and experience. It considered cultural fit, growth trajectory, workload distribution, onboarding timeline, and budget implications. I had been focused primarily on technical qualifications, but the comprehensive reasoning revealed a much fuller picture.

This is why systematic thinking creates genuine intellectual partnership. You're not just getting AI's conclusions—you're gaining access to AI's analytical framework.

But here's crucial guidance: asking AI to think systematically doesn't mean accepting its reasoning uncritically. The value is in seeing the logical structure and evaluating whether it makes sense for your specific situation.

You can say: "Your reasoning framework is helpful, but step three assumes we have more budget flexibility than we actually do. How would you adjust the analysis with tighter financial constraints?" This kind of reasoning refinement often leads to more practical and actionable insights.

Here's your challenge for this week: identify one complex decision or analysis you're currently facing. Instead of asking AI for advice, ask it to help you think through the decision systematically. Start with: "Let's work through this challenge step by step. What key factors should I consider, and how do they relate to each other?"

Watch what happens. You'll likely get not just better analysis, but a framework for approaching similar challenges in the future.

Remember: systematic thinking with AI isn't about letting AI think for you. It's about using AI to enhance your own analytical capabilities. You get better reasoning, more comprehensive analysis, and stronger problem-solving skills through repeated exposure to systematic thinking processes.

Next episode, we'll add the final essential element: context. You'll learn how to provide AI with the situational awareness that transforms good reasoning into perfectly tailored solutions. That's when your AI communication becomes truly sophisticated.

The most successful AI users don't just ask for answers. They ask for better thinking. And systematic reasoning is how you unlock AI's most sophisticated analytical capabilities.
