## Series DNA: The Philosophy of Honest Confusion

**Core Mission**: Teach AI through the radical honesty that even the creators are improvising, learning, and frequently surprised by their own creations. Transform confusion from shame into curiosity, uncertainty from weakness into wisdom.

**The Revolutionary Promise**: *"We'll learn together by admitting what nobody wants to say out loud—that the most advanced technology in human history is built by people who are often as baffled by it as you are."*
