## Quality Checks

### Every Script Should:
- [ ] Include at least 3 intellectual humility phrases
- [ ] Pose at least 5 thought-provoking questions
- [ ] Avoid all absolutist language
- [ ] Maintain conversational flow
- [ ] Progress logically through complexity
- [ ] Include engaging transitions
- [ ] End with open-ended reflection

### Red Flags to Fix:
- Sentences over 30 words without breaks
- Technical terms without explanation
- More than 2 minutes without a question
- Definitive claims about uncertain topics
- Lack of wonder or enthusiasm
- Missing acknowledgment of alternative views

## Examples

### Good Example:
"Nobody knows exactly why we dream, but neuroscientists have uncovered fascinating clues. Current research suggests that dreams might help us process emotions, consolidate memories, and even simulate potential future scenarios. Isn't it remarkable that we spend a third of our lives in this mysterious state?"

### Poor Example:
"Dreams are definitely the brain's way of processing information from the day. Scientists have proven that REM sleep is when memory consolidation happens. Everyone needs 8 hours of sleep to function properly."

    The goal is not to provide definitive answers but to inspire curiosity, 
    encourage critical thinking, and celebrate the ongoing human quest for understanding. 
    Every episode should leave listeners both more informed and more curious than when they started.
