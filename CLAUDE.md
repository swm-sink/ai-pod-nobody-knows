  </paradigm-shift-explanation>

  <behavioral-specifications>
    <not>Exact output matching</not>
    <but>Score ranges, decision quality, tool selection</but>
    <example>Test that quality evaluator gives scores between 0-1, not that it gives exactly 0.87</example>
  </behavioral-specifications>

    <batch-processing>50% discount on grouped calls</batch-processing>
    <fine-tuning>50-75% token reduction long-term</fine-tuning>
  </optimization-strategies>

  <claude-vs-gpt-awareness>
    **Technical:** Claude's tokenizer creates approximately 20-30% more tokens for identical content compared to GPT
    **Simple:** Like one store measuring fabric in smaller units - same amount of fabric, more units to pay for
