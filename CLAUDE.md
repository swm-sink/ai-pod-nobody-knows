  <critical-requirement type="MANDATORY">
    <principle>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) PRINCIPLE MUST BE ENFORCED EVERYWHERE</principle>
    <learning-value>

## üõ°Ô∏è FILE OPERATIONS BEST PRACTICES

<file-operations-best-practices>
  <critical-requirement type="MANDATORY">
    <principle>ALL file operations must be verified, safe, and educational</principle>
    <learning-value>
      **Technical:** File operation safety prevents data loss, corruption, and system instability
      **Simple:** Like double-checking before cutting paper - measure twice, cut once
    </learning-value>
  </critical-requirement>

  <directory-verification>
    <requirement>ALWAYS use explicit paths (no assumptions)</requirement>
    <requirement>Use find command for comprehensive searches</requirement>
    <requirement>Check hidden folders with ls -la</requirement>
    <requirement>Verify existence before operations</requirement>
    
    <educational-examples>
      <example>
        **Technical:** Explicit path verification prevents relative path ambiguity in different execution contexts
        **Simple:** Like giving someone the full street address instead of "the house near the store"
        **Command:** ls -la /full/absolute/path/
        **Learning:** Absolute paths work from anywhere, relative paths depend on where you are
      </example>
    </educational-examples>
  </directory-verification>

  <file-search-procedures>
    <use>find /full/path -name "pattern" -type f</use>
    <not>ls pattern (may miss hidden files)</not>
    <use>grep -r for content searches</use>
    <always>Always specify full paths</always>
    
    <educational-examples>
      <example>
        **Technical:** find command provides comprehensive filesystem traversal with type filtering
        **Simple:** Like having a search dog that can find specific types of items in every corner
        **Command:** find /Users/user/project -name "*.md" -type f
        **Learning:** find searches everything, ls only shows what's visible in current directory
      </example>
    </educational-examples>
  </file-search-procedures>

  <move-delete-safety>
    <requirement>Verify source exists first</requirement>
    <requirement>Check git status before bulk operations</requirement>
    <requirement>Use -i flag for interactive confirmation when risky</requirement>
    <requirement>Create backups for critical operations</requirement>
    
    <safety-commands>
      <verification>ls -la source_file || echo "Source not found"</verification>
      <git-check>git status --porcelain</git-check>
      <backup>cp important_file important_file.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)</backup>
    </safety-commands>
    
    <educational-examples>
      <example>
        **Technical:** Interactive confirmation prevents accidental destructive operations in production
        **Simple:** Like asking "Are you sure?" before permanently deleting family photos
        **Command:** rm -i potentially_important_file
        **Learning:** -i flag makes commands ask before doing potentially dangerous things
      </example>
    </educational-examples>
  </move-delete-safety>

  <common-pitfalls-prevention>
    <pitfall>Hidden folders may not show in basic ls</pitfall>
    <pitfall>Empty directory removal may cascade</pitfall>
    <pitfall>Relative paths can be ambiguous</pitfall>
    <pitfall>Shell expansion may not work as expected</pitfall>
    
    <educational-solutions>
      <solution>
        **Technical:** Hidden files (starting with .) are excluded by default in ls for security
        **Simple:** Like secret files that are only visible when you specifically look for them
        **Command:** ls -la to see ALL files including hidden ones
        **Learning:** Many config files are hidden to prevent accidental modification
      </solution>
    </educational-solutions>
  </common-pitfalls-prevention>

## üö´ ANTI-PATTERN PREVENTION

<anti-pattern-prevention>
  <critical-importance>
    PREVENTING ANTI-PATTERNS IS ESSENTIAL FOR SYSTEM RELIABILITY
    ANTI-PATTERNS CAUSE MAINTENANCE NIGHTMARES AND TECHNICAL DEBT
  </critical-importance>

  <forbidden-patterns>
    <pattern type="status-tracking">
      **Forbidden:** status="pending"/"completed" attributes in markdown documentation
      **Technical:** Hardcoded status creates synchronization problems between documentation and actual state
      **Simple:** Like writing "done" on a todo list instead of actually crossing things off - gets out of sync
      **Required:** Use dynamic JSON session files for state tracking
    </pattern>
    
    <pattern type="hardcoded-progress">
      **Forbidden:** Hardcoded progress indicators in documentation
      **Technical:** Static progress markers don't reflect actual system state changes
      **Simple:** Like a fake progress bar that doesn't show real progress
      **Required:** Dynamic progress calculation from session data
    </pattern>
    
    <pattern type="circular-dependencies">
      **Forbidden:** Circular dependencies between components
      **Technical:** Circular dependencies create impossible initialization orders and tight coupling
      **Simple:** Like two people both waiting for each other to go first through a door
      **Required:** Clear dependency hierarchy (Level 1 ‚Üí Level 2 ‚Üí Level 3 ‚Üí Level 4)
    </pattern>
    
    <pattern type="vague-criteria">
      **Forbidden:** Vague success criteria
      **Technical:** Non-measurable criteria prevent automated testing and validation
      **Simple:** Like saying "make it good" instead of "make it red and 10 inches tall"
      **Required:** Specific metrics with thresholds (e.g., "<$5 per episode")
    </pattern>
    
    <pattern type="untestable-claims">
      **Forbidden:** Untestable claims
      **Technical:** Unverifiable assertions lead to documentation drift and system inconsistencies
      **Simple:** Like claiming something works without being able to prove it
      **Required:** Include validation commands for every technical claim
    </pattern>
  </forbidden-patterns>

  <required-patterns>
    <pattern type="state-tracking">
      **Required:** Use JSON session files in appropriate level directories
      **Technical:** JSON provides structured, parseable state representation with schema validation
      **Simple:** Like keeping organized records in filing cabinets instead of sticky notes everywhere
      **Location:** .claude/*/sessions/ directories
    </pattern>
    
    <pattern type="single-responsibility">
      **Required:** Each agent/command/tool has one clear purpose
      **Technical:** Single Responsibility Principle reduces complexity and improves testability
      **Simple:** Like having specialized tools - a hammer for nails, screwdriver for screws
      **Validation:** Each component should be describable in one sentence
    </pattern>
    
    <pattern type="visible-state">
      **Required:** All progress/state tracked in visible session files
      **Technical:** Transparent state management enables debugging and system introspection
      **Simple:** Like being able to see the gears turning in a clear-sided watch
      **Implementation:** Everything important gets saved to trackable files
    </pattern>
  </required-patterns>
</anti-pattern-prevention>

## üß† CONTEXT ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK

<context-engineering>
  <evolution-explanation>
    **Technical:** Context engineering optimizes information architecture for 200K token attention mechanisms
    **Simple:** Like organizing your desk so you can find the right tool instantly for any task
    **Learning:** This is 2025's advancement beyond 2023's simple prompt engineering
  </evolution-explanation>
  
  <definition>
    "Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window 
    with just the right information for the next step." - Andrej Karpathy, 2025
  </definition>
  
  <claude-specifics>
    <window>200,000 tokens available (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)</window>
    <optimization>
      **Technical:** Long document placement at prompt start leverages positional attention bias
      **Simple:** Like putting the most important information at the top where it's seen first
      - Place long documents (20K+ tokens) at TOP of prompt
      - Instructions at END for better recall
      - Ground responses in quotes from documents
      - Use summary compression after interactions
    </optimization>
  </claude-specifics>
  
  <memory-patterns>
    <external-store>
      **Technical:** External storage decouples context from working memory constraints
      **Simple:** Like using a notebook to remember things instead of trying to keep everything in your head
      Write important facts to files, retrieve when needed
    </external-store>
    
    <summary-compression>
      **Technical:** Periodic summarization prevents context window overflow while preserving semantic content
      **Simple:** Like taking notes during a long meeting instead of trying to remember every word
      Summarize every few interactions to prevent overflow
    </summary-compression>
  </memory-patterns>
</context-engineering>

      Hallucinations occur due to pattern completion over incomplete training data leading to confident but incorrect outputs
    </technical-explanation>
    <simple-explanation>
      Like a confident storyteller who fills in missing details with believable but wrong information
    </simple-explanation>
    <solution>
      - Chain-of-thought verification with &lt;thinking&gt; tags
      - Multi-query consensus (ask 5 times, check variance)

    <simple-explanation>
      Like someone distracting you while performing a magic trick to make you miss important details
    </simple-explanation>
    <solution>

  </protection-2>
  
  <protection-3 name="Circular Reasoning Guards">
    <problem>Model loops in self-referential logic</problem>
    <technical-explanation>
      Recursive reasoning without external validation can create logical loops that reinforce incorrect conclusions
    </technical-explanation>
    <simple-explanation>
      Like asking someone to prove they're telling the truth by having them promise they're telling the truth
    </simple-explanation>
    <solution>
      - Step-by-step reasoning enforcement
      - External fact validation
      - Break complex queries into subtasks
    </solution>
  </protection-3>
  
  <protection-4 name="Injection Attack Prevention">
    <problem>Malicious prompts manipulate model behavior</problem>
    <technical-explanation>
      Prompt injection exploits instruction-following behavior to override intended system behavior
    </technical-explanation>
    <simple-explanation>
      Like someone sneaking new instructions into a recipe while you're cooking
    </simple-explanation>
    <solution>
      - Input sanitization layers
      - Output validation against expected patterns
      - Role-based access controls
    </solution>
  </protection-4>
  
  <protection-5 name="Context Overflow Protection">
    <problem>Token limit exceeded, losing critical context</problem>
    <technical-explanation>
      Context window limitations can cause important information to be truncated during processing
    </technical-explanation>
    <simple-explanation>
      Like trying to write notes on a piece of paper that's too small - important stuff gets cut off
