# ElevenLabs Tool Reference Fix - Validation Report

## Fix Summary
**Target File:** `.claude/level-2-production/agents/09_audio_synthesizer.md`
**Issue:** Incorrect tool reference `text_to_speech` instead of `mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Changes Made
- Updated 6 occurrences of `text_to_speech` to `mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech`
- Created timestamped backup: `09_audio_synthesizer.md.backup_20250812_005911`
- Verified all changes using diff command

## Validation Results
- ✅ Backup file created successfully 
- ✅ sed/Edit commands executed without errors
- ✅ New tool reference matches exact MCP format specification  
- ✅ No other content accidentally modified in file
- ✅ File remains readable and properly formatted
- ✅ grep confirms mcp__ElevenLabs__text_to_speech present (6 references)
- ✅ grep confirms no remaining standalone text_to_speech references
- ✅ diff output shows only expected changes (6 lines modified)

## Specific Changes
1. Line 4: tools array in YAML frontmatter
2. Line 44: TTS Provider description
3. Line 50: Primary Tool documentation
4. Line 54: Tool invocation example 1
5. Line 113: Process workflow documentation
6. Line 232: Tool invocation example 2

## File Integrity
- YAML frontmatter valid and intact
- Agent metadata preserved
- All documentation sections maintained
- No syntax errors introduced

## Critical Impact
This fix resolves a BLOCKING issue that would prevent audio generation entirely. The audio synthesizer agent will now correctly invoke the ElevenLabs MCP tool for text-to-speech synthesis.

```bash
cp 09_audio_synthesizer.md.backup_20250812_005911 09_audio_synthesizer.md
