### Recommendations for Content Creation

#### Content Structure Suggestions:
1. **Opening Hook:** Use He Jiankui scandal as entry point to complexity
2. **Framework Tour:** Walk through different ethical lenses systematically
3. **Stakeholder Voices:** Feature contrasting perspectives on same issues
4. **Uncertainty Showcase:** Highlight areas where experts admit ignorance
5. **Future Questions:** End with unresolved dilemmas and ongoing debates

#### Brand Integration Points:
- Emphasize Doudna's humility despite Nobel status
- Celebrate productive disagreement between disability advocates and medical researchers
- Highlight how uncertainty can inform rather than paralyze ethical thinking
- Show how experts change their minds as evidence evolves

#### Complexity Management:
- Use germline vs. somatic distinction as organizing principle
- Connect technical limitations to ethical implications
- Balance scientific detail with ethical analysis
- Maintain 15-minute target with multi-perspective structure
