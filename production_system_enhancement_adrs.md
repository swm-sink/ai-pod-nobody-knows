# Production System Enhancement ADRs

## ADR-PSE-001: Agent System Architecture Enhancement
**Decision**: Create specialized enhancement agents based on Episode 1 learnings
**Components**:
- enhanced-audio-optimizer.md (IPA tagging, timing precision)
- enhanced-brand-authenticator.md (organic "Nobody Knows" framework)
- ai-quality-predictor.md (real-time assessment)
**Rationale**: Episode 1 showed need for specialized optimization capabilities

## ADR-PSE-002: Command System Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Integrate Episode 1 proven patterns into existing commands
**Components**:
- /produce-enhanced.md (15-min timing, 6 quotes, organic brand)
- /research-enhanced.md (8-10 query strategy)
- /assess.md (9.6+/10 framework)
**Rationale**: Systematic integration of validated methodologies

## ADR-PSE-003: Context Architecture Documentation
**Decision**: Enhance context files with battle testing learnings
**Components**:
- audio_synthesis_unified.md (IPA frameworks)
- perplexity_integration.md (8-10 query strategy)
- quality_validation_unified.md (9.6+/10 standards)
**Rationale**: Comprehensive knowledge preservation and standardization

## ADR-PSE-004: Parallel Processing Framework
**Decision**: Implement microservices architecture for 40% efficiency gains
**Implementation**: Document frameworks without immediate deployment
**Rationale**: Prepare infrastructure for scalable production
