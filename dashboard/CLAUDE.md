## üéØ DASHBOARD MONITORING CONTEXT

**Technical:** Dashboard system memory implementing real-time production monitoring, cost analytics, quality metrics visualization, and system health tracking for comprehensive AI podcast production oversight.

**Simple:** Like having a mission control center that shows you everything happening in your podcast production system in real-time.

**Connection:** This teaches system monitoring, analytics design, and operational intelligence essential for managing complex AI automation systems.
